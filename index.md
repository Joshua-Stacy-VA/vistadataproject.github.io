__Veteran Integrated Cloud Services__ (VICS) provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for maintaining VistA and the VA workflows it supports using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices. VICS will be deployed within the VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud using Amazon Web Services.

__Strategic Benefits__:
  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 100+ distinct VistA systems.
  * Current VA clients (CPRS/JLV) and workflows fully supported and secured
  * Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VistA Client activity
  * Safely and incrementally migrate and retire VistA functionality enterprise-wide, with *no loss of veteran-specific care or services*
  * Implement commodity commercial clinical and business systems, while preserving veteran-specific care and services
  * Move from disparate data centers to single Fedramp-approved commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care

__Current state of migration to Amazon Cloud__:
