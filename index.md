The Veterans Information Systems Technology Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the comprehensive  longitudinal  clinical, business, and administrative information system of the U.S. Veterans Health Administration ([VHA](https://www.va.gov/health/aboutVHA.asp)). 130 decentralized VISTA instances support the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.

## Accelerating VA Modernization

In the VISTA Data Project, the functionality across all VISTA systems is centralized to a single, secure, commercial cloud-based __Veteran Integrated Care Service (VICS)__,  allowing  the corresponding functionality of all 130 VISTA systems to be safely and comprehensively decomissioned enterprise-wide while maintaining seamless continuity of veteran-specific care and services. This enables:

__Strategic Benefits__:

  * New, maintainable, centralized, cloud-based veteran care services based on mainstream technology
  * Current clients (CPRS/JLV) supported,  secured, and centralized enforcing continuity of VA Care coverage
  * May now safely incrementally retire *all* legacy VISTA systems, with no loss of veteran-specific care or services
  * May now implement commodity commercial clinical and business systems (EHR/ERP), while preserving veteran-specific care and services
