# VistA Data Project

The Veterans Information System Technology Architecture ([VistA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the integrated, comprehensive, longitudinal health information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ([VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs)). For the past 35 years, 130 VistA systems have supported the veteran and VA-specific clinical, financial, and administrative functions and operations of the VA's 1200 hospitals and clinics across the United States. [ [VISTA Background](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/tree/master/Background/vista) ].  The VistA systems now contain hundreds of billions of veteran data, but is challenging to comprehensively access.

VistA's data model - the roadmap to all of VA's institutional, business process, and clinical know-how and data - has evolved organically over the past 35 years, but has not been surfaced and leveraged in computable form.  Now, for the first time, VISTA's data model will be comprehensively exposed, enriched, and operationalized as a single, secure, symmetric read-write, server-side interface to all VISTA data for external interfacing and integration. The VISTA data model is in turn normalized across all VISTA system models, allowing secure read-write access across all 131 VISTA systems enterprise-wide using a single Master VISTA Data Model (__MVDM__).

## VISTA Interfacing Evolution
*The figure summarizes the evolution from __thousands of unique, inconsistent, insecure, unidirectional code-based interfaces__ to that of a __single, standardized, secure, server-side, symmetric (bidirectional) Linked Data model-driven interface__ - the Master VistA Data Model (MVDM).*

# VISTA Data Project

The Veterans Information Systems Technology Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs integrated longitudinal  clinical, business, and administrative information system that supports the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.  

The VISTA Data Project is a new data-centric, model-driven approach to VA master data management, interfacing, and security.  VISTA's data model - the roadmap to all of VA's institutional, business, and clinical processes and data - has evolved organically over the past 35 years, but has not been surfaced and leveraged in computable form. 

Now, for the first time, VA's native transactional clinical and business data model - the VISTA Data Model -  will be comprehensively exposed, enriched, and operationalized as a single, secure, symmetric read-write, server-side interface for all clinical operational VISTA data. 

The VISTA Data Model is in turn normalized across all local VISTA system data models to create a national, standardized Master Veteran Data Model (MVDM), allowing read-write transactions across all VA VISTA systems using a single, secure, veteran-centric, model-driven mechanism, MVDM Services:

__Veteran Integrated Cloud Services__ (VICS) provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for maintaining VistA and the VA workflows it supports using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices. VICS will be deployed within the VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud using Amazon Web Services.  

For the current state of VistA's migration to centralized services, see: http://vistaadaptivemaintenance.info/
