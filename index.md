## Continuity of Veteran Care during EHR Modernization

__VISTA Adaptive Maintenance (VAM)__  provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for maintaining VistA and the VA workflows it supports in an efficient, secure, centralized, cost-effective, commercially-supported manner during VA's multi-year EHR Modernization (EHRM) program.  

VAM will be hosted in production within the VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud using Amazon Web Services.

__Strategic Benefits__:

  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining over a hundred legacy VistA systems during multi-year EHRM transition
  * Current VA clients (CPRS/JLV) and workflows fully supported and secured
  * Safely and incrementally migrate and retire legacy VISTA systems, with *no loss of veteran-specific care or services*
  * Implement commodity commercial clinical (EHR) and business (ERP) systems, while preserving veteran-specific care and services
  * Move from disparate data centers to single Fedramp-approved cloud without disturbing veteran care
