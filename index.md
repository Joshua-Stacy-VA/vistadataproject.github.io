## Continuity of Veteran Care during EHRM Transition
The Veterans Information Systems Technology Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the comprehensive  longitudinal  clinical, business, and administrative information system of the U.S. Veterans Health Administration ([VHA](https://www.va.gov/health/aboutVHA.asp)). 130 VISTA instances support the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.

__VISTA Adaptive Maintenance (VAM)__ provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for maintaining VISTA and the VA workflows it supports during the multi-year transition to VA's new EHRM. VAM enables VA to move from 130 separate, complex, unmaintainable VISTA systems to modern, simplified, commercially-managed centralized cloud-based services.


__Strategic Benefits__:

  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining 130 legacy VISTA systems during multi-year EHRM deployment
  * Current VA clients (CPRS/JLV) and workflows fully supported and secured
  * Safely and incrementally retire *all* legacy VISTA systems, with no loss of veteran-specific care or services
  * Implement commodity commercial clinical (EHR) and business (ERP) systems, while preserving veteran-specific care and services
  * Move from disparate data centers to single Fedramp-approved cloud without disturbing veteran care
