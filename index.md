The Veterans Information Systems Technology Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the comprehensive  longitudinal  clinical, business, and administrative information system of the U.S. Veterans Health Administration ([VHA](https://www.va.gov/health/aboutVHA.asp)). 130 decentralized VISTA instances support the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.

In the VISTA Data Project (VDP), the functionality across all decentralized VISTA systems is centralized to a single secure, cloud-based, veteran-specific Veteran Integrated Care Service (VICS),  allowing  the corresponding functionality of the 130 decentralized VISTA systems to be decomissioned while maintaining seamless continuity of veteran-specific care and services.

__Strategic Benefits__:

  * New, maintainable, centralized, cloud-based veteran care services based on mainstream technology
  * Current clients (CPRS/JLV) supported and secured, enforcing continuity of VA Care coverage
  * May now safely incrementally retire legacy MUMPS VISTA systems, with no loss of veteran-specific care or services
  * May now implement Commodity COTS clinical and business systems (EHR/ERP), while preserving veteran-specific care and services
