![vam-aws -width95](assets/vam-aws-v9.png)


__VISTA Adaptive Maintenance__ (VAM) provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for maintaining VistA and the VA workflows it supports as straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices during the multi-year transition to VA’s new commercial clinical and business information systems.

VAM enables VA to transition the many distinct, decentralized, legacy VistA systems to a single set of centralized cloud-based microservices - Veteran Integrated Care Services (VICS) - while maintaining full backwards-compatibility and seamless continuity of care and services of the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).

VAM will be deployed within the VA’s Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Amazon CloudWatch.


__Strategic Benefits__:

  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 100+ distinct legacy VistA systems during multi-year commercial EHR transition.
  * Current VA clients (CPRS/JLV) and workflows fully supported and secured
  * Safely and incrementally migrate and retire VistA functionality enterprise-wide, with *no loss of veteran-specific care or services*
  * Implement commodity commercial clinical (EHR) and business (ERP) systems, while preserving veteran-specific care and services
  * Move from disparate data centers to single Fedramp-approved commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
