## Continuity of Veteran Care during EHRM Transition

__VISTA Adaptive Maintenance (VAM)__  is a Veteran-focused Integration Program (VIP) that provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for maintaining VISTA and the VA workflows it supports in an efficient, cost-effective manner during the multi-year transition to VA’s new commercial EHR. 

VAM enables VA to transition from 130 separate, complex, unmaintainable VISTA systems  to a single, secure, commercially-managed set of centralized cloud-based services - Veteran Integrated Care Services (VICS) -  while maintaining full backwards-compatibility and continuity of care and workflows of the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). VAM will be hosted in production within the VA’s Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

__Strategic Benefits__:

  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining 130 legacy VISTA systems during multi-year EHRM deployment
  * Current VA clients (CPRS/JLV) and workflows fully supported and secured
  * Safely and incrementally retire *all* legacy VISTA systems, with no loss of veteran-specific care or services
  * Implement commodity commercial clinical (EHR) and business (ERP) systems, while preserving veteran-specific care and services
  * Move from disparate data centers to single Fedramp-approved cloud without disturbing veteran care
