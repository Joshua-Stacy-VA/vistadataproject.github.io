 VISTA in the Cloud has vastly improved speed, scalability, security, and reliability.  This is by virtue of VA implementing  the U.S. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy fully for the VA *VISTA* systems.

### Cloud-First
VA is currently implementing the [U.S. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) for its most mission-critical enterprise systems such as *VISTA*. 

In this first phase *U.S. Cloud-First Strategy*, VA is migrating *VISTA* from the many diverse, decentralized, legacy on-premises data centers to a single, modern, centralizedm commercial cloud, the VA Enterprise Cloud.

### Cloud-Smart
VA is implementing [*U.S. Cloud-Smart Strategy*](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/#cloud-smart) for *VISTA* through cloud-specific  __*VISTA* Adaptive Maintenance__ (VAM), which provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for cloud-native optimization and security for *VISTA* to the highest standards in the U.S. government, using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices.

Both *VISTA* and VAM will be implemented within VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud leveraging Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)).  


### Strategic Benefits
  * Move VISTA from disparate VA data centers to single Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
  * Safely and incrementally centralize VISTA functionality in the Cloud, with *no loss of VA- or veteran-specific care or services*
  * Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VISTA client activity
  * Current VISTA clients and workflows fully supported and secured
  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 130 distinct, decentralized VISTA systems during multi-year VA modernization transition.
