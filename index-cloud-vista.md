# Cloud VISTA
VA is implementing the [U.S. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) for the VA's *VISTA* systems. This strategy incorporates both the U.S. Cloud-First Strategy and U.S. Cloud-Smart Strategy.

## Cloud-First
In VA's *Cloud-First Strategy* for *VISTA*, VA is migrating *VISTA* from the many diverse, decentralized, legacy on-premises data centers to a single, centralized, modern commercial cloud: the VA Enterprise Cloud.  This simplifies and unifies management of the 130 *VISTA* systems from a single centralized location, modernizes VA's enterprise IT infrastructure, and eliminates then need to manage and maintain many duplicative data centers, allowing legacy infrastructure to be decomissioned.

## Cloud-Smart
In VA's [*Cloud-Smart Strategy*](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/#cloud-smart) for VISTA, VA is implementing cloud-specific *VISTA* Adaptive Maintenance (VAM), which provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for cloud-native optimization and security for *VISTA* to the highest standards in the U.S. government, using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices.

Both *VISTA* and VAM will be implemented within VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud leveraging Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)).  

## Strategic Benefits
  * Move VISTA from disparate VA data centers to single Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 130 distinct, decentralized VISTA systems during multi-year VA modernization transition.
  * Safely and incrementally centralize VISTA functionality in the Cloud, with *no loss of VA- or veteran-specific care or services*
  * Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VISTA end-user client activity
  * Current VISTA clients and workflows fully supported and secured
