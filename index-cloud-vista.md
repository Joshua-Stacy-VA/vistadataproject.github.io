# Cloud VISTA: Cloud First. Cloud Smart.
VA is implementing the [U.S. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) for the VA *VISTA* systems. This strategy is comprised of the Cloud-First Strategy (cloud migration) and Cloud-Smart Strategy (cloud-native optimizations).

### Cloud-First
In VA's *Cloud-First Strategy* for *VISTA*,  VA is migrating *VISTA* from the many diverse, decentralized, legacy on-premises data centers to a single, modern, centralized, commercial cloud:  the VA Enterprise Cloud.  This "lift-and-shift" phase does not involve any modifications to the migrated system to take advantage of any cloud-native capabilities of the Cloud.

### Cloud-Smart
In VA's [*Cloud-Smart Strategy*](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/#cloud-smart) for VISTA, VA is implementing cloud-native __*VISTA* Adaptive Maintenance__ (VAM), which provides a cloud-based roadmap and software for cloud-native optimization and security for *VISTA* to the highest standards in the U.S. government, using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices.

Both *VISTA* and VAM will be implemented within VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud leveraging Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)).  

### Strategic Benefits
  * Move VISTA from disparate VA data centers to single Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
  * Safely and incrementally centralize VISTA functionality in the Cloud, with *no loss of VA- or veteran-specific care or services*
  * Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VISTA client activity
  * Current VISTA clients and workflows fully supported and secured
  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 130 distinct, decentralized VISTA systems during multi-year VA modernization transition.
