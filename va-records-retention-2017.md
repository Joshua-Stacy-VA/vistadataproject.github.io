PURPOSEThe Records Control Schedule (RCS) 10-1 provides Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records retention and disposition requirements for VHA Central Office, Program Offices, and field facilities.  The primary purpose of this revision is to incorporate changes to RCS 10-1 issued since the last publication date of March 20, 2017. The schedule is divided into eight chapters.  Each chapter covers a group of records, e.g., chapter one covers administrative records.  The first four chapters include most of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules (GRS).  Space for additional records schedules is available to allow for future expansion.  The VHA Records Management Office intends to update this schedule every three years in order to publish the most up to date records management requirements.  Between updates the VHA Records Management Office will post new or revised schedules on the HIM/RM (Health Information Management/Records Management) website.  Schedules are not required to be in the RCS 10-1 to be a legal schedule. Once a schedule is approved by the Archivist of the United States it must be used to manage the agencyÕs records.2. INTRODUCTIONa. Title 44, Section 3301, of the United States (U.S.) Code defines records as Òall books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials or other documentary materials, regardless of the physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the U.S. Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the government or because of the information value of data in them.  Library and museum material made oracquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents preserved only for convenience or reference, and stocks of publications and of processed documents are not included. These items are referred to as non-record materials.b. The VHA Records Control Schedule (RCS) 10-1 is the main authority for the retention and disposition requirements of VHA records.  It provides a brief description of the records and states the retention period and disposition requirements.  It also provides the NARA disposition authorities or the GRS authorities, whichever is appropriate for the records, in addition to program and service sections.c. The GRS provides disposal authorities for temporary administrative records common to all Federal agencies.  It covers records relating to: personnel, budget and finance, procurement, information technology, and other common functions and activities of Federal agencies.  Any deviation from the GRS must be authorized by NARA in accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1228.42(B).  Requests for deviations from either the RCS 10-1 or GRSretention and disposition requirements are to be submitted to the VHA Records Management Office via the Facility requesting the change and the primary VHA Program Office with authority over the record type that is being requested for change.3. RECORDS MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIESa. The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Informatics and Analytics (10P2), Executive Director Information Governance (10P2C) Health Information Management/Records Management Office will be referred to as the VHA Records Management Office throughout this document.  The VHA Records Management Office is responsible for developing policies and procedures for effective and efficient records management throughout VHA including VHA Program Offices and Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Centers. In addition, the Office acts as the liaison between VHA and NARA on issues pertaining to records management practices and procedures.b. VHA Field/Facility Records Managers are responsible for all records management activities at their site.c. All VHA employees are responsible for ensuring that records are created, maintained, protected, and dispositioned in accordance with NARA regulations and VA policies and procedures.4. DISPOSITION OF RECORDSThe RCS 10-1 contains retention and disposition requirements for VHA records authorized by NARA or assigned a GRS authority.  Record disposition refers to the transfer of records to an approved records storage facility, transfer of permanent records to NARA, the destruction of records, or other appropriate actions to dispose of records.  Unless retrieved; records transferred to a storage facility shall be dispositioned after expiration of their retention requirements.5. PERMANENT AND UNSCHEDULED RECORDSPermanent and unscheduled records in VHA custody must be reported through the VHA Records Management Office to NARA.  Permanent (archival) records are defined as records appraised by NARA to have sufficient historical value or other value to warrant permanent preservation at the NARA.  Un-appraised and unscheduled records are records that have not been evaluated to determine their record retention or disposition.  Such records are to be retained until they receive disposition authority from NARA.  The VHA Program Offices responsible for unscheduled records shall work with the Field/Facility Records Manager, VHA Records Management Office and the VHA Records Officer to identify, describe and submit to NARA a request for disposition authority using the NARA electronic Records Archives (ERA) system.6. MEDIA NEUTRAL RECORDSa. A media neutral schedule item on a records disposition schedule (i.e., SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority or NARA Electronic Records Archives (ERA) records scheduling module)  applies to the described records regardless of their medium.  Program offices must submit a new schedule request through the VHA Records Management Office to NARA for approval of electronic versions of previously scheduled records if:(1) The content and function of the records have changed significantly (e.g., the electronic records contain information that is substantially different from the information included in the hard copy series or are used for different purposes).(2) The previously approved schedule explicitly excluded electronic records.(3) The electronic records consist of program records maintained on an agency Web site. (4) The electronic records consist of temporary program records maintained in a formatother than scanned image AND the previously approved schedule is not media neutral.b. Temporary still pictures, sound recordings, motion picture film, and video recordings.  Apply the previously approved schedule to digital versions.c. Scanned images of temporary records, including temporary program records.  Apply the previously approved schedule.d. Other temporary records maintained in an electronic format other than scanned images:(1) For temporary records that are covered by an item in the GRS (other than those GRS items that exclude electronic master files and databases) or an agency-specific schedule that pertains to administrative housekeeping activities, apply the previously approved schedule.  If the electronic records consist of information drawn from multiple hard copy series, apply the previously approved schedule item with the longest retention period.  This is common when creating an electronic system that replaces a number of paper and electronic record types.  The older systems and paper records are now placed into a new system.  In the past these records may have covered various disposition life cycles. In the case of finance records the range could have been from one to six years.  If the records in the new electronic system cannot be dispositioned separately then they must be kept for the longest disposition, in this case six years.(2) For temporary program records covered by a NARA-approved media neutral schedule item (i.e., the item appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval before December 17, 2007, that is explicitly stated to be media neutral, or it appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval on or after December 17, 2007, that is not explicitly limited to a specific recordkeeping medium), are considered media neutral.  An example of this is the Health Records Folder File or Consolidated Health Record (CHR).  The original NARA approved records disposition schedulewas NARA (Job No. N1-15-91-6 item 1).  This schedule was written and approved in 1991 and was for the paper health record only.  In 2000 (VHA) created an ÒElectronic Health RecordÓ. Since this record was not paper VHA was required to submit to NARA a request for an electronic record schedule NARA (Job No.N1-15-02-3).  This records schedule was created in2002 which makes both the paper and electronic health record media neutral for future changes.7. DAMAGE TO AND UNAUTHORIZED DESTRUCTION OF RECORDSa. VHA records shall not be disposed of without the proper authorization to do so.  Federal law prohibits unauthorized destruction or mutilation of Federal records.  The penalty for such acts is a $2,000 fine, 3 years in prison, or both pursuant to Title 18 United States Code 2071.  Damage to, and unauthorized destruction of records is to be reported to the VHA Records Office immediately upon knowledge of such an act of destruction.b. VHA officials must take measures to ensure that records are not disposed of improperly. Records are not to be removed from VHA custody or destroyed without regard to the requirements of this schedule or the GRS.  When records are improperly disposed, NARA regulations and VA policy require the submission of a report to NARA.  The report must include the record description, volume, date of incident, etc.  Specific reporting requirements are contained in NARA regulations, Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1228, Disposition of Federal Records, and VA Handbook 6300.1, Chapter 6., Records Management Procedures.8. RECORDS FREEZES/LITIGATION HOLDSa. Records freeze:  Records whose scheduled disposition has been temporarily suspended because of special circumstances that alter the administrative, legal, or fiscal value of the records.b. Litigation hold:  The Office of General Counsel (OGC) may periodically issue a litigation hold or moratorium on the disposition of certain records because the records may be potentially responsive or helpful in ongoing or pending litigation (lawsuits).c. A "hold" is simply the implementation of a litigation hold notice issued by an OGC Office. Upon receipt, the records manager must suspend the normal disposition cycle of the recordslisted in the hold notice to prevent their early/premature disposal.  Holds are placed on records in an agency's physical custody.d. A "freeze" is created when the records manager receives a hold notice for records not in the agencyÕs physical custody but in the custody of the VA Records Center and Vault (RC&V), a Federal Record Center (FRC), or a commercial records storage facility.  The Facility Records Manager would ask NARA to create a freeze to halt premature disposition of the records.  Since most litigations deal with relatively current agency activity, the number of freezes is significantly smaller than the number of holds since the agency still has physical custody of most records affected by holds.e. Upon receipt of a hold notice the records manager should initiate a freeze on any off-site records in conjunction with the hold placed on the on-site records in physical custody.  This ensures that any potentially responsive record is preserved regardless of its physical location.f. The Office of General Counsel maintains a list of litigation holds at the following website: OGC Litigation Share Point:  https://vaww.ogc.vaco.portal.va.gov/litigation/Lists/active/AllItems.aspxg. Additional information may be found at the following NARA website:http://www.archives.gov/frc/arcis/freeze-faq.pdf9. VITAL/ESSENTIAL RECORDSVital/Essential records are defined as essential records needed to maintain the continuity of Federal government activities during and following a national emergency or a technological or natural disaster and to protect the rights and interests of VA beneficiaries and employees. Additional information can be found in VA Handbook 6300.2.10. PERSONAL PAPERSPersonal papers consist of documents that relate only to an individualÕs personal affairs and do not affect the conduct of government business.  Examples of personal papers are diaries, journals or other personal notes that are not created in the process of transacting government business. Personal papers may be disposed of in accordance with the ownerÕs preference.  Note: Personal notes included on an official calendar or files are subject to official records authorities.11. TERMINATION OF OFFICE/SERVICE AND DEACTIVATION OF FIELD FACILITYa.  Specific records management procedures are to be followed when terminating an office/service or deactivating a field facility.  The procedures are contained in VA Handbook6300.1.  It is important to follow these procedures to prevent the loss or unauthorized destruction of VHA records.b.  Once it has been determined to abolish an office/service or to deactivate a field facility, the office or facility records manager is to be consulted so that certain measures are taken to prevent the premature destruction of records.  An evaluation is to be conducted to determine those records that are eligible for immediate destruction, identify records that are to be transferred to the successor office/service or facility, identify records that are eligible for transfer to a recordsstorage facility, and identify records of permanent value to be offered to the NARA.  Records are not to be disposed of without proper authority to do so.12. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) POLICYa. VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management, provides the policy for records and information management.b. VA Handbook 6300.1, Records Management Procedures, specifies procedures for implementing the records management program.c. VA Handbook 6300.2, Management of the Vital Records Program, implements the VA VitalRecords Program which is an integral component of the VA Emergency Preparedness Plan.d. VA Handbook 6300.8, Procedures for Shipment of Records to the RC&V in Neosho, Missouri, provides procedures for transferring records to the RC&V.PART TWOCHAPTER 1GENERAL ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT RECORDS1000-1999The records described in this chapter pertain to performance of office and other administrative management functions throughout VHA CO, Program Offices and facilities and to techniques and programs that develop, control and improve management processes. These techniques and programs relate to the organization and planning, management analysis, acquisition program management, office methods, records, forms, reports and publication management, data processing; inspections, management sciences, and overall management of programs.1000-1099NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION GRS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATION1000Records Common to Most Offices within Agencies(GRS-23)1000.1.  This schedule provides for the disposal of certain records common to most offices in Federal agencies. It covers administrative subject files; facilitative records such as suspense files, tracking and control records, calendars, and indexes; and transitory documents. This schedule does not apply to any materials that the agency has determined to be non- record or to materials, such as calendars or work schedules, claimed as personal.Office Administrative Files described under item 1 are records retained by an originating office as its record of initiation of an action request or response to request for information. This item may be applied only to separate administrative files containing such records as copies of documents submitted to other offices for action including budget feeder documents, purchase orders, and training request. Item 1 may not be applied to files that also contain program records and may not be applied by an office that receives and takes action on documents submitted by other offices.a.	Office Administration Files: Records accumulated by individual offices that relate to the internal administration or housekeepingactivities of the office rather than the functions for which the office exists. In general, these records relate to the office organization, staffing, procedures, and communications, including facsimile machine logs; the expenditure offunds, including budget records; day-to-day administration of office personnel including training and travel; supplies and office services and equipment requests and receipts; and the use of office space and utilities. They may also include copies of internal activity and workloadreports (including work progress, statistical, and narrative reports prepared in the office and forwarded to higher levels) and other materials that do not serve as unique documentation of the programs of the office.Superseded by GRS 5.1 item 010, DAA-GRS-2016-0016-0001, NARA Transmittal #28 July 2017.b.

Most of these records are administrative housekeeping records. Agencies create and maintain administrative records when carrying out general, non-mission-related activities that keep an office operating. In contrast, agencies create mission records when carrying out the unique activities for which the agency was established. The only mission-related records this schedule covers are non-recordkeeping copies of electronic records(item 020) that are maintained for decision-making purposes or taking action. Copies maintained solely for convenience of reference are considered non-record materials. This schedule may be applied to records in offices that carry out mission-related activities, but only those records that are described here.This schedule does not apply to transitory records,which are scheduled in GRS 5.2. The distinction between transitory and the records covered in this schedule is that the records here generally have a longer period of business use than transitory records. This schedule also does not cover materials an agency determines to be non-record or personal. Neither does this schedule cover common administrative records found in most offices that are scheduled elsewhere inthe GRS, such as timekeeping and procurement records.1001.1  Administrative records maintained in any agency office. Records accumulated by individual offices that relate to routine day-to-day administration and management of the office rather than the mission- specific activities for which the office exists. Records include:¥	staff locators, unofficial organizational charts, and office seating charts (see Exclusion 1)¥	office-level administrative policies and procedures and files related to their de velo p me nt  (s ee  Not e  1 )  ¥ cale nd ars or   schedules of daily activities of non-high- level officials (high-level officials are defined in GRS 6.1; this item covers thosepositions not defined as high-level)¥	informal requests and tracking of personnel training, travel, supplies, and equipment, excluding procurement and payment records and forms requesting training (e.g. SF-182)¥	internal office activity and workload reports¥	studies and analyses of office administrative functions and activities¥	non-mission related management reviews and surveys¥	minutes of meetings related to administrative activitiesTemporary; destroy when business use ceases. (GRS 5.1 item 010, DAA-GRS-2016-0016-0001)definition of Federal records, and any related attachments¥	electronic spreadsheets¥	digital still pictures or posters¥	digital video or audio files¥	digital maps or architectural drawings¥	copies of the above electronic records maintained on websites or web servers,but EXCLUDING web pages themselvesTemporary; destroy immediately after copying to a recordkeeping system or otherwise preserving, but longer retention is authorized if required for business use. (GRS 5.1 item 020, DAA-GRS-2016-0002)[NOTE 1: Non-recordkeeping copies may be Federal records. Often, copies are non-records and can be immediately destroyed, but not always. Copies are non- record if they are kept only for convenience of reference. If copies are used in the course of agency business to make decisions or take action, they are Federal records. The copies described here are Federal records if they are still being used by the agency for such business purposes, but are not recordkeeping copies of those records.][NOTE 2: For electronic mail records, therecordkeeping system must capture the names of sender and recipients, date (transmission data forrecordkeeping purposes), and any receipt data, along with the message text. Sender/recipient information should be individual account information, not the name of a distribution list.]EXCLUSION: This item does not apply to recordkeeping copies of organizational charts, functional statements, and related records that document the mission-related organization, staffing, and procedures of the office. Agencies must schedule those records on an agency-specific schedule.[NOTE: This item covers administrative policies and procedures at the office/unit level. GRS 5.7 covers agency-level administrative issuances or directives.]1001.2.  Non-recordkeeping copies of electronic records. Non-recordkeeping copies of electronic records agencies maintain in email systems, computer hard drives or networks, web servers, or other locations after agencies copy the records to a recordkeeping system or otherwise preserve the recordkeeping version. This includes:¥	documents such as letters, memoranda, reports, handbooks, directives, manuals, briefings, or presentations created on office applications, including those in Portable Document Format (PDF) or its equivalent¥	 sen der sÕ  a nd  r eci pient sÕ  ver sio n s  of electronic mail messages that meet the1001.3.  Records of non-mission related internal agency committees. Records created and maintained by committees established by an agency for facilitative or op erati on al  p ur po ses  un relate d  to  the  ag e ncy Õs  missi on, such as organizing events, selecting interior furnishings, overseeing volunteer activities, or employee recreational activities. Records include:?	meeting minutes, summaries, agendas, and transcripts?	reports and studies?	membership records?	correspondence, mailing, and distribution recordsEXCLUSION: These items do not cover records of Federal Advisory Committee Act or interagency committees. GRS 6.2 covers Federal Advisory Committee Act committee records.[NOTE: Records of mission-related committees are potentially permanent and agencies must schedule them by an agency-specific records schedule.]1003Administrative Management Records(GRS-16)This schedule provides for the disposal of certain records relating to administrative management activities in Federal agencies, excluding records of operating personnel, budget, accounting, and printing functions, which are covered by other GRSÕs. Included within the scope of the schedule are disposable records created in the course of organizational planning, development, and simplification of procedures; records management activities; and administration of management improvement programs. GRS 1 (Items 12 and13) provide for the disposition of case files on individuals involved in incentive award and similar types of management improvement programs. Any records created prior to January 1, 1939, must be offered NARA before applying these disposition instructions.The organizational locations and titles of administrative management units vary from agency to agency. They may be scattered at numerous levels or locations, or may be centralized. For the purposes of this schedule, the nomenclature standards set forth by the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments (replaces Senate Committee on Government Operations) in Senate Report 243 (replaces 245), 80th Congress, 1st session, are followed: the first organizational level within an agency is the bureau level; subordinate components are, successively, division, branch, section, and unit.This schedule is based on the presumption that management activities are carried on by a specialized person or unit with, at least, division-wide and usually bureau-wide or agency-wide responsibilities or by a group of such persons or units in an agency, although its provisions are applicable to exactly comparable records ofagencies without such formal assignments of responsibility. Many similar or comparable records created at lower organizational levels or in field offices vary so greatly in content, value, and arrangement that they are not coveredby this schedule.Because of the nature of the activities documented by administrative management records, a relatively large proportion of them are of continuing value. Files with potential archival value are not covered by the GRS. They must be scheduled individually by submission of a Standard Form (SF) 115 to NARA. These records includeorganizational charts and reorganization studies, functional statements, delegations of authority, and agency histories. However, related temporary or ephemeral materials include working papers that do not have a direct bearing on the transaction, intermediate drafts of documents andworksheets that do not represent significant basic steps in the preparation of final drafts, letters or memoranda of Transmittal and acknowledgment, routing slips, and extra copies of documents.1003.1.

(DAA-GRS-2013-0006-0008)2100.6. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) AdministrativeRecords.Records are PKI-unique administrative records that establish or support authentication by tying the user to a valid electronic credential and other administrative non- PKI records that are retained to attest to the reliability of the PKI transaction process. Included are policies and procedures planning records; stand-up configuration and validation records; operation records; audit and monitor records; and termination, consolidation, or reorganizing records.Policies and procedures planning records relate to defining and establishing PKI systems. Records relate to such activities as determining that a PKI should be established; creating project implementation plans; creating the certificate policy (CP), certification practice statement (CPS), and other key operating documents; developing procedures in accordance with the CP and CPS; conducting risk analyses; developing records management policies (including migration strategies); and selecting the entitythat will serve as registration authority (RA). Stand-up configuration and validation records relate to installing and validating both the Certification Authority (CA) and Registration Authority (RA), obtaining final approval or rejection from the agency's oversight or authorizing body, creating and generating a CA signature key, testing security procedures for the CA and RA, validating certification revocation procedures, and establishing back-up andstorage for the PKI system. Operation records relate to the certification application; certificate issuance and key generation (including key pair generation and private key loading and storage of private keys and components of private keys); certificate acceptance, validation, revocation, suspension, replacement, and renewal; creating and maintaining an event log; and installing and validating software updates. Audit and monitor records relate to conducting periodic internal and external reviews of auditable events specified in the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) X.509 Certificate Policy and other Entity CA policies, monitoring compliance with security requirements specified in the CPS and other operating procedures, investigating internal fraud or misconduct, and conducting internal and external audits of software and systems security.Termination, consolidation, or reorganization records relate to terminating, consolidating, or reorganizing a PKI; notifying subscribers of decisions, transferring inactivekeys and revocation certificate lists to storage repositories, transferring consenting subscribers' and certificates and related materials to a new Certificate Authority, destroying sensitive records involving privacy (in accordance with an authorized records schedule), and shutting down and disposing of RA hardware and CA software.a.

(N1-GRS-07-3, item13a2/061)[NOTE: Select PKI administrative records serve as transaction records that must be retained as part of the trust documentation set with transaction-specific records. Agencies must determine which PKI administrative records are embedded with transaction-specific records as transaction records. These administrative records may vary from transaction-to-transaction.]c.	PKI transaction-specific records. Records relate to transaction-specific records that are generated for each transaction using PKI digital signature technology. Records are embedded or referenced within the transaction stream and may be appended to the transaction content or information record. Along with PKI administrative and other administrative records, transaction-specific records are part of the PKI trust documentation set that establish or support the trustworthiness of a transaction. They may vary from transaction-to- transaction and agency-to-agency. When retainedto support the authentication of an electronic transaction content record (information record), PKI digital signature transaction records are program records.Temporary; destroy/delete when 7 years 6 months to 20 years 6 months old, based on the maximum level of operation of the appropriate CA and after the information record the PKI is designed to protect and/or access is destroyed according to an authorized schedule, or in thecase of permanent records, when the record is transferred to NARA legal custody. Longer retention is authorized if the agency determines that transaction-specific PKI records are needed for a longer period. (N1-GRS-07-3, item 13b/062)[NOTE: Extreme care must be taken when applying the GRS-PKI to transaction records. Destruction of the transaction-specific and administrative records embeddedin the transaction stream prior to the authorized retention of the information record that they access/protect will render the PKI incapable of performing what it is designed to do- protect and provide access to the information record. Dueto the relative newness of PKI technology, both from an implementation and a litigation perspective, it is recommended that agencies identify all PKI transaction records (including PKI select administrative records embedded in the transaction stream and transaction-specificrecords) to be retained as part of the trust documentation for the records the PKI is designed to protect and or access and link the retention of the transaction records with that of the information record it protects/accesses. Transaction records must be retained as trust documentation set records together with the content/information record.]2200Input Records, Output Records, and Electronic Copies(GRS 4.3)and whose content is incorporated in its entirety into an electronic system.Superseded by GRS 5.2 item 020, DAA-GRS-2017-0003-0002 NARA Transmittal #28, dated July 2017.2200.2.

CIO Records.This schedule provides disposal authorization for certain records created and maintained by Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) and their program offices. This schedule applies to the records of CIOs at agency or departmental Central Office as well as those of deputy and subordinate CIOs at the bureau or field office level. This schedule does not apply to officials with Government-wide responsibilities for information resources management (IRM) and information technology (IT) governance.In accordance with the Clinger-Cohen Act (originally the Information Technology Management Reform Act), CIOs of 24 major departments and agencies have IRM as their primary duty. They are responsible for advising and assisting the agencyÕs executive with IT acquisition and management; developing and maintaining the agencyÕs IT architecture; promoting the efficient design and operation of the agencyÕs major information resources management processes; monitoring the performance of IT programs of the agency; and developing the knowledge and skill of IT staff. CIOs may also lead, coordinate, or participate in programs to support the mandates of the Paperwork Reduction Act, Government Paperwork Elimination Act, Federal Records Act, E-Government Act of 2002, Privacy Act, Government Performance and Results Act, and other Federal laws and regulations relating to IRM.This schedule does not cover all records relating to thework of CIOs. CIOs are often responsible for programs and activities whose records are already covered by anapproved GRS. Records not described in this or any otherGRS must be scheduled by submission to NARA of an SF115, Request for Records Disposition Authority. If records are part of a larger case file or recordkeeping system that contains records not covered in this schedule, agencies must separately schedule those records or systems by submitting an SF 115 to NARA. If records covered bymore than one item in this schedule are maintained together in one file or recordkeeping system, agencies must retainthe records for the longest retention period authorized for those items.The disposition instructions apply to records regardless of physical form or characteristics. Records may be maintained in any format on any medium.Note that GRS 20, Electronic Records, remains in effect. GRS 20 covers certain temporary files associated with database management. This schedule supplements GRS 20 by providing disposal authority for records relating to the administration of a CIOÕs office, as opposed to the operation and use of specific systems. This schedule does not apply to the data or information content of IT systems. Records relating to specific systems that support or document the agencyÕs mission must be scheduled individually by submission of an SF 115 to NARA.a.	Information Technology (IT) Program Planning Records. Records relating to the development of agency IT programs. Included are records that document agency-wide IT goals; specify milestones to be achieved; identify performance measures for the agencyÕs IT portfolio; or summarize the underlying principles and approach by which the agency will plan for and manage its IT resources.

This schedule applies to the pay records that are common to all agencies, but it excludes (a) retirement records (Standard Form (SF) 2806 or equivalent) that are maintained during employee duty and then transferred to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); (b) files maintained in agency space for audit by theGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S.C.3529(c); (c) records relating to tax withholding, savings bonds, fidelity bonds, or other records held by the appropriate units of the Treasury Department responsible for the related Government-wide programs; and (d) Officeof Management and Budget files reflecting agency personnel needs and problems. The NARA must be consulted for any records created prior to January 1, 1921 before applying these disposition instructions.Documents required by the Comptroller General to be maintained for site audit are segments of accountable officer's accounts. In no event may disposal be made of records pertaining to accounts, claims, or demands involving the Government of the United States which have not been settled or adjusted by the GAO unless the agency concerned has written approval of the Comptroller General, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3309. Most Federal civilian pay accounts are prepared and maintained in accordance with Title 6 - Pay, Leave, and Allowances and incorporated in the GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies.In the payrolling process different types of records are accumulated. Under Title 6 of the GAO Manual these records are normally site-audited on a sample basis by GAO representatives who examine primarily the earnings record card, payroll change slips that are prepared to document changes in normal pay, certification sheets containing the signatures of the certifying officer, checklists prepared in lieu of the more formal payrolls by Department of the Treasury or local disbursing personnel, source personnel documents such as basic time and attendance reports, and copies of personnel action forms documenting changes in pay. In addition, pay registers and other accounting devices are maintained to check and balance the accounts.[NOTE: All payroll systems require the maintenance of a leave record used to submit data to the payroll system. Information is posted to this record from more detailed records kept by time and attendance clerks located throughout an agency. Depending on the type of system in operation, this leave record may be a hard-copy input form or it may be a wholly electronic input.]Other records incidental to the payrolling process are employee requests for tax withholding; employee requests for Thrift Savings Plan deductions; savings bond records; and other records not pertaining to individuals, but rather to the general administration of the payrolling office and the payrolling function3100.1.

It does not apply to copies of records forwarded to the Department of Treasury or the Office of Management and Budget in fulfillment of reporting requirements.  These forwarded copies serve unique business purposes at those agencies and are therefore scheduled separately as records of OMB and Treasury.This schedule covers financial management records of grants and cooperative agreements but does not cover administrative records of such grants and agreements. These administrative records are covered in GRS 1.2.This schedule covers financial transactions and reporting but not overall planning for finance.  These records are covered under current GRS 5, which will likely reappear as new GRS 10.3.This schedule covers contract records maintained by Federal agencies but not records maintained by contractors, which are governed by 48 CFR 4, subpart 4.7.This schedule covers financial transactions as an administrative function common to all agencies, but not administrative records documenting unique agency missions, such as student loan collection or seeking reimbursement for Superfund cleanups.4000.1.a.

(GRS-5)Budget and apportionment records include the various files accumulated in an agency in the course of formulating its budget for submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and to the Congress; in defending its requests for funds before both bodies; and after enactment of an appropriation bill, in ensuring that the funds are used in such a way as to suffice for the appropriate period of time. The funds are made available to the agency by OMB, usually in quarterly portions, and the agencies mustindicate and justify regularly to OMB their proposed rate of expenditure. After the funds have been made available tothe agency, its own controls over the funds are in its expenditure accounting records (Schedule 7), and detailed information relative to expenditures is contained in the accountable officers' accounts (Schedule 6).This schedule applies to certain records of budget preparation and apportionment in all agencies, but does not apply to records of OMB and the Department of Treasury reflecting the Government-wide budget responsibilities of those agencies. Records created prior to January 1, 1921, must be offered to the NARA before applying the disposition instructions.Agency budget records are normally created at all levels of agency organization. They show proposals from all operating levels as well as the bureau-wide and agency- wide coordinating work done by formally organized budget offices. Therefore the records consist of detailed work papers and budgetary statements developed by single operating units, the more significant budget statements and related papers representing consolidated submissions prepared at the bureau or equivalent level and forwarded tothe agency budget officer, and the records at the highest level pertaining to the budget submission for the entire agency.The nature of the budget presentation itself is standardized by OMB which prescribes format and procedures for all Federal agencies. However, the internal reports and papers which support the budget and are used in its preparation vary from agency to agency. The budget submission, a record copy of which is usually designated by the agency,is a duplicate of the set of papers submitted to OMB. These include summary statements of appropriations and expenditures, statements of contract authorizations, and statements of receipts as well as narrative summary statements which highlight the principal features of the agency requests and immediately related supporting documents. The narrative presents the policies and the programs of the agency which the budgetary requests are to support. In addition to the summaries, the submission includes schedules of obligations and statements pertaining to each type of appropriation and fund under which the individual agency operates. Finally, OMB requires additional supporting data pertaining to objects of expenditure, particular agency programs, and figures based on the cost of various type of service operations, such as personnel and payrolling activities.4100.1.

Depending on agency recordkeeping practices and patterns of documentation, these records may have archival value and must be scheduled by submitting a Standard Form 115 to NARA. (GRS 5, 1952, items 1 and2)]CHAPTER 5LOGISTICS AND FACILITIES5000-59995000Procurement and Supply Records(GRS-3)Agency procurement and supply records document the acquisition of goods and non-personal services, controlling the volume of stock on hand, reporting procurement needs, and related supply matters which are part of daily procurement operations. The basic procurement files reflect a considerable range of procedure, from simple, small purchases to complicated prime contractor and subcontractor operations.Any records created prior to 1895 must first be offered to the NARA for appraisal before applying the disposal instructions. Frequently copies of procurement papers become integral parts of the other files in the agency, such as project files of various types or general subject files pertaining to program operations; such copies are not covered by this schedule because they cannot be considered and evaluated separately from the files of which they are a part.The General Accounting Office (GAO) no longer requires agencies to maintain a separate file of contracts for site audit. The agency contract files maintained in the contracting officer's office are accessible to GAO auditors and have generally been used by them in the past.When a claim is filed by or against the Government, records relating to the claim should be retained without regard to the otherwise applicable records retention schedules which would have authorized destruction of the records prior to the time when the claim is finally resolved unless the agency has received written approval from the GAO (44 U.S.C. Section 3309 and 62 Comp. Gen. 42 (1982)). A claim is finally resolved: (1) when it is disallowed and the time for appealing the denial or instituting suit on the claim has expired; or (2) when it is allowed and paid or the amount offered in compromise is accepted and paid; or (3) when the amount found due and owing proves uncollectible because time limits for collecting the indebtedness through legal proceedings or by way of setoff have expired.Records documenting procurement and supply in the agencies are largely standardized by various regulations of the Comptroller General and the Administrator of General Services. The physical arrangement of the transaction files themselves differs in the various agencies, however. In all agencies the official contract files, for example, contain a minimum core of specified documents, but there are also other documents that vary in accordance with what the individual agency deems to be best for its own operating purposes.The key procurement file is the transaction case file containing the formal contract or informal purchase order or lease instruments and all related papers. The documents flowing into the transaction file differ in detail, but they include, in addition to the purchase document, specifications, bids, schedules of delivery, the initiating requisition, invoices, and correspondence. Other copies of these documents, made for expediting and other administrative purposes, are scattered throughout the inspection, shipping, expediting, and other units of the agency procurement organization.Other files related to the procurement and supply function include reports used for supply management purposes by the agency creating the records as well as the staff agency involved with Government-wide programs. They also include local requisition and stock inventory files and other minor supply papers. Of a specialized character in the procurement field are the title papers documenting the acquisition of real property (by purchase, condemnation, donation, exchange, or otherwise). These papers are required by the Government as long as the propertyremains in Government hands or if it has been sold or released -- conditionally or with recapture clauses. When properties are disposed of by quitclaim deeds, this fact should be confirmed prior to the disposal of title papers, since the title evidence might be needed by the Government to defend the title in the event the properties were disposed of by deeds containing general or special warranties.It should also be ascertained that the title evidence relates only to the properties which were sold by the Government. In many instances, lands acquired by the Government are disposed of in different size parcels, and if the Government retains the title to any portion the title evidence should be retained.This schedule does not apply to Interior Department records relating to the public domain or to the title opinion files of the Department of Justice.This schedule includes some of the common agency records relating to grant programs. Since many Federal agencies conduct grant programs which document projectscontracted between the agency and an outside party, these records are included as an adjunct to the procurement and supply records.[NOTE: Many of the record disposition schedules in GRS-3 have been changed by the GRS record disposition schedules in GRS 1.1 in Chapter 4 of this manual.]5000.1.

Standard Form (SF) 114, Sale of Government Property, Invitation, Bid, and Acceptance. Related papers that are maintained by the agencies, usually in case fashion, consist of correspondence, bids, other notices of sale, invoices, and sales slips.?	SF 120, Report of Excess Personal Property, and SF 121, Quarterly Report of Utilization and Disposal of Excess and Surplus Personal Property. Agencies use SF 120 to report excess personal property to the regional GSA offices, which initiate screening action. The quarterly reports are submitted to the Office of Property Management, Office of Federal Supply and Services, GSA, which consolidates the data.5050.1.  Property Disposal Correspondence Files.

These records, which reflect the net monetary worth of an agency and its assets, are periodically reconciled with the supply data found in stock inventory records, but they do not include procurement papers. Any records created prior to January 1, 1921, must be offered to theNARA before applying these disposition instructions.and from storage points, although they may be involved in posting. Summary data on plant value are also available in pertinent ledger accounts.b. Plant Accounting. These records document principal characteristics of each item of physical plant and equipment, including real property. They constitute primarily a type of inventory control, but in addition are a principal source of data on the capital investment in physical plant (as distinguished from maintenance or operating costs) and other items not normally represented in a store or stock inventory system. Summary data on plant value are also maintained.c. Cost Accounting. These records are designed to show accumulated data on the costs of agency operation, the direct and indirect costs of production, administration, and performance of program functions of the agency. The data, which are normally accumulated by means of cost reports and statistics accumulated by operating personnel, are ultimately integrated into the accounts concerned with operating and program costs. Material cost information is collected by posting requisitions for material or procurement documents to intermediate records, and labor cost information is obtained by charging time expended on individual jobs and projects assigned control numbers for cost control purposes. Cost data are used in evaluating economy of agency operation and in preparing budget estimates.5070.1.

Many of these records have continuing historical value after they are no longer being used by the agency. Descriptions of both historically valuable and temporary records were formerly included in General Records Schedule 17, Cartographic, Remote Sensing Imagery, and Related Records, and in General Records Schedule 22, Design and Construction Drawings and Related Records. The General Records Schedules have been revised to cover only temporary records, and this schedule covers temporary records formerly included in those two schedules. Guidelines for identifying and scheduling the records of continuing value are now provided in "Managing Cartographic and Architectural Records: An Instructional Guide." The Guide must be used in conjunction with the General Records Schedule to ensure proper disposition of all cartographic, aerial photographic, architectural, and engineering design records held by an agency.This schedule relates to cartographic records prepared during intermediate stages of publication, unannotated aerial photographic negatives and prints, and architectural and engineering drawings. Cartographic and aerial photographic records created before January 1, 1950, and architectural or engineering drawings created before January 1, 1921, must be brought to the attention of the NARA before applying the disposition instructions in this schedule.Superseded; (GRS 5.4, Item 010) (DAA-GRS-2016-0011-0001) (Subject code: 5020.1).5200.1.

Included are selected files of offices having Government-wide or agency-wide responsibility for Law enforcement and protective services programs. Also included are files of police services and other organizational elements documenting the control of classified information, access to facilities, and like matters.This schedule authorizes for disposal records documenting administrative actions relating to the above functions. Records documenting Government-wide or agency-wide security and protective services planning and programming, reflecting basic overall policies and determinations are not authorized for disposal by this schedule. Variations among agencies in methods of implementing statutoryrequirements for police services, physical security and protective services result in dissimilarities in program documentation. The application of standard techniques of filing and disposition to such records through the medium of a General Records Schedule is therefore impractical. Any records created prior to January 1, 1921, must be offered to the NARA before applying these disposition instructions.5251Classified Information Accounting and Control RecordsRecords accumulating from measures taken by agencies to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with Executive orders and statutory or regulatory requirements.5251.1.

(DAA-0015-2016-0006-0003).6200.6. Pre-Operative Case Management Tool. Before a provider can determine whether a patient isa candidate for surgery, the patient often needs aseries of preoperative assessments andprocedures. Because VA facility staff are discouraged from using independent mechanisms to track patients, as these may be perceived as unauthorized waitlists, the National Surgery Office (NSO) developed the Pre- Operative Case Management (POCM) tool to track patientsÕ   required pre-operative consults, diagnostic tests, and procedures before a determination of surgical candidacy can be made.  The POCM tool is not a waitlist nor intended to be a system of record, and it does not replace existing VA scheduling or medical record systems.  Use of this tool is optional. POCM coordinators and/or providers at a facility enter patients and workups ordered by the clinician that they anticipate may delay the determination of surgical candidacy.  Once all workup items are completed, POCM alerts designated personnel the patient information is ready for review. If no additional workups are necessary, surgical candidacy determination is noted and the patient status is set to complete.Patient workup information is maintained in a SharePoint list for presentation to POCM users while workups are pending. All patient and workup information is also written to a SQL database to provide PHI blinded reporting capabilities. After 30 days, patient data with a Complete status is removed from the SharePoint view.Temporary; cutoff at end of CY, destroy 10 years after cutoff. (DAA-0015-2016-0006-0004).6200.7.

VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program(VASQIP) Database.Monitors and reports risk-adjusted (O/E) surgical outcomes and actual (unadjusted) mortality for major surgical procedures performed at each VA medical center for all operations combined and for each surgical specialty on a quarterly basis and for the rolling year. An analysis and review of the VA medical center structure and process will be prompted based upon the reporting of a statistically high O/E ratio.The VASQIP uses logistic regression analysis to calculate the probability of death or complication for each patient in the database, based on the patient's preoperative risk factors. These probabilities can then be summed for all surgical procedures performed by the VHA surgical programs to arriveat an expected number of events (mortality, morbidity) for all operations including the following surgical specialties: cardiac surgery, general surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, urology, and vascular surgery. The observed number of events (O) divided by the expected number of events (E) produces the O/E ratio for the procedures performed at any single VA medical center. As reference, an O/E ratio of 1.0 indicates that the observed number of events is equal to the number of events expectedbased upon the patient mix in a given specialty at thatVA medical center.Temporary; cutoff at end of CY, destroy 20 years after cutoff.
