title: Workload "DSS" Demo
---

VISTA is a lot more than a Clinical Care System. It also provides non clinical services which help run hospitals and clinics. One key Non Clinical Service is _Workload Measurement_, accounting for the type of work performed by providers for patients. This helps the VA monitor hospital costs and is the basis for billing. 

Like much else in VISTA, the applications and utilities for Workload are bound up with clinical application routines. As part of separating VISTA's Clinical and Non Clinical function, the VISTA Data Project (VDP) has created a _Veteran Workload Service_ and _Browser_ which demonstrate how VISTA manages and monitors workload. Both service and browser provide a basis for VA-wide, VISTA-system independent workload management. Such a national service would centralize workload collection and storage.

## About Workload in the VA and VISTA

> VHA collects workload data that supports the continuity of patient care, resource allocation, performance measurement, quality management, and third-party collections. Decision Support System (DSS) Identifiers assist VA medical centers in defining workload, which is critical for costing purposes. DSS Identifiers are used to identify workload for all outpatient encounters, inpatient appointments in outpatient clinics, and inpatient billable professional services. They also serve as guides to select DSS outpatient department structures.

and

> VHA facilities are required to report all electronic data concerning the provision of services in VHA facilities to the National Patient Care Database (NPCD) in Austin, TX. VHA facilities must ensure that all encounters in outpatient settings, inpatient appointments in outpatient clinics and inpatient billable services are identified, coded, completed and reside in the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package for transmission to NPCD.
