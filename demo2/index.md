Message: beyond clinical -- VISTA and Workload 

overall this month, the patient had two MH exams (C&P and Social work one), three X-Rays, 

ie/ for this month go into all workload and related items (orders, docs etc)

REM: 9 work details (AUDIOLOGY x 2 but maybe one is a dud?) and 

TODO:
- audiology dud?
- entered by for LAB
- make sure health factors
- a/c for consult
- suggest document changes to 
(see issues)
- READ DOCUMENT OF PHONE as should be in person ??? ie/ CPT wrong?

1. 21st has WD MH 1 with V CPT/V POV/V PROVIDER and Document off it. Document not entered til the 24th, signed on the 1st of the following month.
   * JENSEN and JENSEN: by a provider called JENSEN at a location named for him
   * CPT is less precise that the two part DSS
   * PRIMARY which means explicitly entered workload
   * Sent to NPCD means work load IS sent to Austin: WHEN?????????
   * ZZIOW means the Place name is deleted
   * One document, a C&P that is entered (transcribed) 3 days later and signed even later
   
2. 25th and 28th have X RAYs
- first one:
  - 2 CPTs (from two orders) and both more precise than DSS
  - automatically entered (side effect of order(s))
  - at a generic location ... named for the function at this institution
  - primary provider is radiology or ???
  - provider has since retired/left (hence ZZ)
