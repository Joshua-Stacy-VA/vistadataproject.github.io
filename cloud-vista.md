# Cloud VISTA Strategy
VA is implementing the [U.S. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) for the VA's Veteran Information Systems Technology and Architecture (VISTA) systems. This strategy incorporates both the U.S. Cloud-First Strategy and U.S. Cloud-Smart Strategy.

## Cloud-First
In VA's *Cloud-First Strategy** for *VISTA*, VA is migrating *VISTA* from the many diverse, decentralized, legacy on-premises data centers to a single, centralized, modern commercial cloud.  This unifies and simplifies management of all *VISTA* systems within a single centralized location, modernizes VA's enterprise IT infrastructure, and eliminates then need to manage and maintain duplicative data centers, allowing legacy infrastructure to be decomissioned.

## Cloud-Smart
In VA's [*Cloud-Smart Strategy*](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/#cloud-smart) for *VISTA*, VA is implementing cloud-specific *VISTA* Adaptive Maintenance (VAM), which provides a roadmap and software for cloud-native scalaility, security, and services for *VISTA* users to the highest standards in the U.S. government and industry, all using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices. *VISTA* will be operationalized with VAM cloud optimizations within VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud leveraging Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)).

## Strategic Benefits
  * Migrate VISTA from disparate VA data centers to single Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 130 distinct, decentralized VISTA systems during multi-year VA modernization transition.
  * Safely and incrementally centralize VISTA functionality in the Cloud, with *no loss of VA- or veteran-specific care or services*
  * Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VISTA end-user client activity
  * Current VISTA clients and workflows fully supported and secured
