The table resolves the many to many relationshipthat can exist between a GCN Seq No and a HIC.  There is a unique HICLSEQNOTBL record for each unique combination of ingredients regardless of the therapeuticclass, the drug strength, the dosage form and the route of administration.The Internal entry number (D0) is the HICLSEQNO with leading zeros removed.HICLSEQNOHIC - RHICL0The HICL Seq No / HIC Relation Table associates one or more ingredients (HIC's)-- to a maximum of 9 -- to a HICLSEQNOTBL.  The HICLSEQNOHIC table is keyed by the concatenation of HICL Seq No and HIC Relative Number.  The HIC Relative Number is an important attribute of the table that allows the sequencing of ingredients for a multi-ingredient HIC Seq No by relative importance.  For instance, a two ingredient product containing Acetaminophen and Codeine would have two HICSEQNOHIC records, one for the Acetaminophen and one for the Codeine,but the HIC Rel No would be 1 for the Codeine (most important) and 2 for the Acetaminophen, second most important.  Although not depicted on the data model,there is an implied relationship between this table and the GCNSEQNOTBL so all applicable HIC values can be determined by accessing this table with the HICL*SEQNO contained in the GCNSEQNOTBL.The Internal entry number (D1) is the Hierarchical Ingredient Code Relative Number (HICRELNO) with leading zeros removed.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>gnn(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td> This field contains the drug ingredient names adopted by USAN.  The chemicalname is used when the USAN name is not available.  For multi-ingredientproducts, abbreviations may be used, e.g. HCTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide), PP(Phenylpropanolamine), CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate), etc. This field is freeformat. However, the data has been generated from a table to provide consistent spelling and sequence  for sorting and reporting applications.The sequence of generic names in multi-ingredient products is determined by therapeutic priority. Every product has specific intended therapeutic usage.The most pharmacologically active ingredient for the intended use will belisted first, followed in descending order of therapeutic significance by theother ingredients. On occasion, this results in a generic name that is in adifferent sequence than the label name, e.g. codeine/aspirin (GNN) andaspirin w/codeine.  Generic Name (GNN) displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.
