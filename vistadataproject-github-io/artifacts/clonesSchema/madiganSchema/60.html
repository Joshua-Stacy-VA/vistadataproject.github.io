Standard tests have been pre-approved for use at all Departmentof Defense facilities. The user can enter certain non-standard tests that must be Panel or QCONLY. In addition, a limited number of Miscellaneous tests are available onthe system to be re-defined as non-standard tests. Re-defined Miscellaneoustests are always Single tests. QC ONLY tests are used internally within the laboratory and are orderedonly on Quality Control specimens using the laboratory QC options. Testsdesignated as QC ONLY may not be changed to non-QC ONLY. To re-define a Miscellaneous test for use at this site, select the name ofa pre-defined Miscellaneous test. The user will be required to modify theMiscellaneous test's name and specify its subscript. When the modificationsto a Miscellaneous test are filed, a mail bulletin will be triggerednotifying members of a mail group that a new  Miscellaneous lab test hasbeen re-defined. The test will be evaluated for future standardization. There-defined Miscellaneous test will be non-standard and orders for the testcannot be transmitted electronically to outside performing facilities.</td></tr><tr><td>.2</td><td>sensitive results</td><td>0;20</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>|NOWRAP| Enter "YES" in this field if the results of this test are sensitive and should be routinely suppressed.  The result will be displayed as"REQUESTING HCP ONLY" unless the user is assigned the "LRSENSITIVE" key or is the requesting HCP.    The results will be suppressed in the options: Lab Patient Inquiry,Patient Episode Cumulative, Doctors Cumulative, and Interim report.  The Inpatient and Outpatient cumulative will always report sensitiveresults as "REQUESTING HCP ONLY".  The lab prints the Sensitive Result Report in order to provide a chart copy of the result. If sensitive tests are referred to the laboratory, results will print on the Referral Report for Sensitive Results.  This report and theSensitive Result Report are printed in the lab so the results canbe handled more discretely. Laboratory users must have the LRSENSLAB key in order to process sensitive tests after log in.</td></tr><tr><td>.21</td><td>loinc component name</td><td>0;21</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8188_1.html">8188.1</a></td><td></td><td>The LOINC Component Name is the name of the component or analyte measured. Examples are "GLUCOSE" for a Chemistry test, "MICROORGANISM IDENTIFIED" for a Microbiology test, or "STUDY REPORT" for an Anatomic Pathology test.A LOINC Component Name must be entered to capture a LOINC Code for a test result. Currently, the field is not in use.

This field isrequired and cannot be changed once it is entered.  If SINGLE is selected, the test can only be entered as QC ONLY and musthave a Clinical Chemistry or Microbiology type subscript. Tests withAnatomic Pathology type subscripts cannot be entered. If PANEL is selected, the test can only be entered as non-QC ONLY and musthave a Clinical Chemistry or Microbiology type subscript. Tests withAnatomic Pathology type subscripts cannot be entered. The specification ofSingle or Panel cannot be changed for standard entries.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>mtf lab method</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="60_19.html">60.19</a></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the lab method being defined.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>synonym</td><td>5;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="60_1.html">60.1</a></td><td></td><td>This is another name for the test.

This represents the majority of testsin the system. An example of a CALCULATED test is Calc. LDL. Results for the Calc. LDLtest are automatically calculated by the system from the results of theTRIGLYCERIDES, CHOLESTEROL, and HDL tests. An example of an INPUT test is a CBC. An order is placed for a CBC, butresults are entered and reported for the individual tests of the CBC (i.e.WBC, RBC, HGB, etc). Single tests do not usually have the "Type" field setto INPUT.  Tests designated as MISCELLANEOUS are used to allow the site to set up newtests as necessary. Tests already assigned as another type cannot bechanged to miscellaneous. Miscellaneous tests are pre-defined in the systemand cannot be added by the site. Whenever a site re-defines a miscellaneoustest, a mail bulletin is generated to a group authorized to evaluate thetest for inclusion as a DOD Standard Lab Test. Tests can be made unorderable by changing the "Type" field to NEITHER. Ifthere is no need to order, edit, or display a test, it may be inactivated by setting the "Inactive Flag" field to YES. Once a test has been madeinactive, it cannot be re-activated. Deleting entries from the Lab Testfile is not allowed, since database integrity will be compromised. Components of a panel are examples of tests that normally have the "Type"field set to OUTPUT. Specific examples are tests such as Appearance,Turbidity, Urine Glucose, Crystals, etc. that are always ordered as part ofa Urinalysis panel.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>subscript(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>CH:CLINICAL CHEMISTRY<br/>BT:BACTERIOLOGY<br/>OP:PARASITOLOGY<br/>TB:MYCOBACTERIUM<br/>MY:MYCOLOGY<br/>VR:VIROLOGY<br/>SP:SURGICAL PATHOLOGY<br/>AU:AUTOPSY<br/>BM:BONE MARROW<br/>CG:CYTOLOGY GYN<br/>CN:CYTOLOGY NON-GYN<br/>VT:VETERINARY<br/>DT:DENTAL<br/>BB:BLOOD BANK<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter a subscript for the Lab Test entry. Examples are CH for Clinical Chemistry, BT for Bacteriology, and SP forSurgical Pathology. Each subscript dictates a unique set of order andresult entry requirements for various lab tests. The Clinical Chemistry subscript allows the user to enter a single resultfor each test. Use CH for most laboratory tests including Chemistry,Hematology, Immunology, and Coagulation tests. New tests with a CHsubscript can be added to the system only as panel tests or QC ONLY tests. The subscripts for Bacteriology, Parasitology, Mycobacterium, Mycology, andVirology comprise the Microbiology test group. Each subscript provides theuser with a specialized result entry screen which is determined by theMicro Screen field designated in the Lab Test file. New tests with aMicrobiology subscript can be added to the system only as panel tests or QCONLY tests. The subscripts for Autopsy, Bone Marrow, Cytology Gynecological, CytologyNon-Gynecological, and Surgical Pathology comprise the Anatomic Pathologytest group. Each subscript provides the user with a specialized resultentry screen. New tests cannot be added with an Anatomic Pathologysubscript. A standard set of tests with the Blood Bank (BB) subscript have been addedto the Lab Test file as part of the interface between CHCS and DBSS(Defense Blood Standard System). New blood bank tests may not be added tothe Lab Test file.</td></tr><tr><td>4.5</td><td>qc only(+)</td><td>0;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter YES if this test is for QC purposes only, NO if test is a panel, or"^" to exit. If a single test, enter "YES" to designate test as QC ONLY. Single teststhat are not used strictly for quality control purposes cannot be added tothis file. If a panel test, enter '^' to delete test or 'NO' to add panel test as a non-QC test. Panel tests cannot be designated for quality control purposes, and therefore should have this field set to NO when being defined. QC ONLY tests may only be used internally within the laboratory and mayonly be ordered on Quality Control specimens using the laboratory QCoptions. Tests that are QC ONLY will usually be done in the Microbiology areas(Bacteriology, Parasitology, Mycology, Mycobacteriology, Virology) andClinical Chemistry. An example of a test that might be defined this way isAMPICILLIN when used by the micro accession area to do quality control onantibiotics.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>mtf default lab method</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8710.html">8710</a></td><td></td><td>This is the lab method chosen as the default for this test.
