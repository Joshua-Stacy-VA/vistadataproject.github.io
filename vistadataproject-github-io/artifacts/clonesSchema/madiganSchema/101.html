If RESULTED,the order has had all tasks resulted. EXPLICITLY DISCONTINUED meansthat an action was taken by a provider to stop this order. TRANSFERREDis the inactive status created when a patient is transferred withinthe MTF. At that point, all orders are 'discontinued' but the providerhas an opportunity to later mark which of these orders he would liketo 'reactivate'. This reactivation actually results in new orders being generated. SIGNATURE MISSING means that an order has beendiscontinued but still needs a signature or countersignature. Itwill continue to show up on the display screen until signed. If aprovider cancels an order requiring a signature, and he is qualifiedto sign that order, the signing takes place automatically and thisstatus is avoided.</td></tr><tr><td>2.04</td><td>pending signature</td><td>2;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING SIGNATURE<br/></td><td></td><td>This pending flag indicates that an order has not been activated because either a nurse or HCP signature has not yet been obtained.</td></tr><tr><td>2.05</td><td>pending appointment</td><td>2;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING APPOINTMENT<br/></td><td></td><td>This pending flag indicates that an order is suspended while awaitingcompletion of the scheduling process. Because one order may generateseveral tasks requiring scheduling, this flag is set when NONE of theremaining tasks have been scheduled - in other words, when there isa potential hold up of the process as a result of schedules not beingcompleted. Once the first task is scheduled, the order is active unlessthe first task is completed and the next task is not yet scheduled.</td></tr><tr><td>2.06</td><td>pending activation</td><td>2;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING ACTIVATION<br/></td><td></td><td>This pending flag indicates when an order has been placed on hold.This status changes either when the user activates the order orwhen the ACTIVATION DATE arrives and the order is taken out ofsuspense automatically. In this instance, the order is then placedin PENDING REVIEW (see next field).</td></tr><tr><td>2.07</td><td>pending review</td><td>2;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING REVIEW<br/></td><td></td><td>This pending flag is set when an order on HOLD (PENDING ACTIVATION)reaches the activation date. Rather than automatically activate theorder, this status alerts the user that the order is due to be activatedafter he/she has reviewed it for its appropriateness at this time.</td></tr><tr><td>2.08</td><td>activation date</td><td>2;8</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>When an order is put in suspense (as for preadmission orders), the useris given the option of indicating an automatic reactivation date.

For lab orders, it indicates the priority for labcollection (how quickly should a specimen be obtained). The twostandard priorities are STAT and ROUTINE. If the order has STAT priority, the system will monitor thetime to acknowledge the order and then the time to result theorder. Times exceeding MTF defined intervals will be tracked forQA.</td></tr><tr><td>2.1</td><td>warning action required</td><td>2;10</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:DISPOSITION NEEDED<br/></td><td></td><td>This pending flag will be set when an order which requires a warningto be overridden in order to become active, has not yet been over-ridden. A nurse may override the order either under authority of anHCP or as an emergency override. The HCP has the ability to eitheroverride the order or kill it. In all cases, the disposition ofa warning will be stored for QA.</td></tr><tr><td>2.11</td><td>appointment cancelled</td><td>2;11</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:APPOINTMENT CANCELLED<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag indicates that an appointment was cancelled.</td></tr><tr><td>2.12</td><td>pending ancillary approval</td><td>2;12</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING ANCILLARY APPROVAL<br/></td><td></td><td>This pending flag indicates when an order has been placed on hold awaitingauthorization.</td></tr><tr><td>2.13</td><td>transfer status</td><td>2;13</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:CANCEL ONLY ON TRANSFER<br/>2:CANCEL AND REACTIVATE ON TRANSFER<br/>3:NEW ORDER<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag indicates what action is taken on an order when the patient istransferred within the MTF.</td></tr><tr><td>2.14</td><td>pending admission</td><td>2;14</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING ADMISSION<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag indicates when an order has been placed on hold.
