In VMS, there can be multiple versions of a file,the version number (sometimes also called revision number) keeps thevarious filenames apart. A directory listing would typically look like:    Directory DISK$ARCHIVE00:[ARCHIVE.1]    1.ARCH;1                   2/3       30-MAR-1994 16:08:30.98   1.ARCH;2                  11/12      28-APR-1994 17:33:38.61   13.ARCH;1                  2/3        1-MAR-1994 15:26:47.59   14.ARCH;1                  1/3        1-MAR-1994 16:35:46.41   15.ARCH;1                  1/3        1-MAR-1994 17:33:13.75 etcetera Now, because these files exist outside of MUMPS, and we want to producesome reports in MUMPS about these files, the directory information iscopied into this FileMan file. (And, to make matters a little morecomplicated: the directory information needs to be gathered on a computerthat is only very loosely connected to a CHCS system, and then transmittedto the system where we store this data, but that is a little outside ofthe scope of this discussion.) In the case of the Archive files, the first part (the number before theperiod) corresponds to the data type.As a matter of coincidence, it is still true that       data type number + 8950 = FileMan ^DD number of Archive fileThe second part of the name ("ARCH") identifies the file as an "archive"file, and the third part (separated by the semicolon) is the version(or revision) number. In this example, for data type 1 (Patient demographics)there are two versions. On magnetic disks, we would remove all 'older' versions, but sincethe Archive is stored on a non-erasable medium, all versions will remainpresent. (If there are multiple versions of an Archive file, that indicatesthat some error has occurred, but we should be able to deal with allcontingencies.)</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>last update(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The value of this field is the FileMan date/time of the mostrecent update of the information in this file.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>file</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8370_7011.html">8370.7011</a></td><td></td><td>The information in this subfile reflects the various sizes of theArchive related files.
