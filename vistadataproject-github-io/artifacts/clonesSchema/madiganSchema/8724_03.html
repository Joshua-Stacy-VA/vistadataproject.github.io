It is merely a sequence number andhas no bearing on how or where the field prints on the label.  It isnecessary so that each entry may be unique per sector.  If, for instance,the user wishes to print the Accession Number as both human-readable textand as a bar code within the same sector, there must be a way to set apartone from another.  If not, when the user first defined the field as a barcode, and then tried to add it again to the same sector as text, the userwould be thrown back into editing the previous entry (the bar coded field),rather than being allowed to enter the same field again as text.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>display name(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td> This is the display name for the element you wish to define on the label.It must be a valid entry in the LABEL FIELDS file, and will be displayedon the 'pick list'.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>user-definable text(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td> This is the text for this field, exactly as it should be printed.  It willappear exactly this way and in this location on EVERY label that uses thislabel design.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>horizontal starting point(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td> This is the horizontal, or 'X', coordinate of the upper left corner ofthe field.  The value must range between zero and the sector width, asspecified in the Label Description File.  Be careful not to place a fieldwithin the space of another field.  Defining adjacent fields requires atleast one millionth of an inch (.000001") of space between each field.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>vertical starting point(+)</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td> This is the vertical, or 'Y', coordinate of the upper left corner of thefield.  The value must range between zero and the sector height, asspecified in the Label Description File.  Be careful not to place a fieldwithin the space of another field.  Defining adjacent fields requires atleast one millionth of an inch (.000001") of space between each field.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>field width(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td> Enter the width, in inches, of the field being defined.  The field widthmust be less than or equal to the distance between the horizontal startingpoint and the sector width, as specified in the Label Description File.This value specifies the size of the field from left to right, and is usedto figure out if the field spatially overlaps other already defined fields.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>field height(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td> This is the height, in inches, of the field being defined.  The value mustbe less than or equal to the distance between the vertical starting pointand the sector height, as specified in the Label Description File.  Thisvalue specifies the size of the field from top to bottom, and is used tofigure out if the field spatially overlaps other already defined fields.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>print from position</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td> This is the position in the field where you wish to begin printing.  If youwish to print the entire field, enter '1'.  If the field is, e.g., AccessionNumber, and it looks like:  920413 CHA 2097 and, if you only want to print the numeric portion of the field, enter'12'.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>print thru position(+)</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td> This is the position in the field where you wish to complete printing.  Ifyou wish to print the entire field, enter the maximum length of the field.If the field is, e.g. Accession Number, and it looks like:  920413 CHA 2097 and, it you only want to print the date portion of the field, enter '6'.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>bar code format</td><td>0;11</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8722.html">8722</a></td><td></td><td> This is the Bar Code Format that will be used to encode the field into abar code.  It must be a valid entry in the Bar Code Format file.  Pleasebe sure that the symbology selected will support the data that will beencoded.  Most bar code symbologies have restrictions on which charactersmay be encoded.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>pitch(+)</td><td>0;12</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>10:10<br/>12:12<br/>16.5:16.5<br/></td><td></td><td> This is the pitch, or font size, in which the field will be printed. Thesevalues are expressed in characters-per-inch (CPI).  A pitch of 10, is astandard 'normal' pitch for most printers.  Pitch values higher than 10indicate 'compressed' printing (more characters printed per inch), asopposed to lower values which indicate enlarged printing (less characters printed per inch.)</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>bold(+)</td><td>0;13</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td> This indicates whether or not this field will be printed in bold text.If set to '0' or left blank, the field will NOT be printed in boldcharacters.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>justification(+)</td><td>0;14</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>L:LEFT<br/>C:CENTER<br/>R:RIGHT<br/></td><td></td><td> This will force the selected field to be either left, right, or center-justified within the print window selected.  If left blank, printing willdefault to left-justified.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>multi-valued print format(+)</td><td>0;16</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>C:COMPACTED<br/>O:ONCE/OCCURRENCE<br/></td><td></td><td> This field allows the user to determine the format to be used when printingmulti-valued fields.  The available choices are:   'C' for compacted mode, where values for the field are printed as xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx... 'O' for once per occurrence, where each time the field is encounteredon the label design, the next value for the multi-valued field will beprinted.</td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>force continuation(+)</td><td>0;17</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td> This value determines whether additional label(s) will print when the datafor the field overflows the defined space on the primary label.  PRIMARYdesigns proceed to CONTINUATION designs.  If no CONTINUATION design isspecified, the PRIMARY design is utilized.  OPTIONAL designs proceed tothe same OPTIONAL design at all times.</td></tr><tr><td>.18</td><td>underline(+)</td><td>0;18</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td> This indicates whether or not this field will be printed in underlined text.If set to '0' or left blank, the field will NOT be printed with underlinedcharacters.</td></tr><tr><td>.19</td><td>delimiter character(+)</td><td>0;19</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>,:, (Comma)<br/>/:/ (Slash)<br/>\:\ (Backslash)<br/>|:| (Vertical Bar)<br/>-:- (Hyphen)<br/>+:+ (Plus Sign)<br/>~:~ (Tilde)<br/> :(1 Blank Space)<br/></td><td></td><td> This field specifies the character to be used to separate individual entriesin a multi-valued field.  This field is only applicable to picklist fieldsthat have the multi-valued flag set to true.  Also, this field is only usedwhen printing multi-valued fields in the COMPACTED format.  When printingin compacted format and using multiple lines on the label, the text willbe word-wrapped at the space or puncuation character closest to the breakpoint.  If there is no space or puncuation character in the text, thetext will be arbitrarily cut and wrapped at the break point position.</td></tr><tr><td>.2</td><td>barcode orientation(+)</td><td>0;20</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>L:LADDER<br/>P:PICKET FENCE<br/></td><td></td><td> This is the orientation of the bar code on the label.  Enter either "P" forPicket Fence style or "L" for Ladder style.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
