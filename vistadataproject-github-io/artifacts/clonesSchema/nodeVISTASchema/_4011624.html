Any number here should never be greater than L(0)-1.  Thiscan represent a sparse array.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>fr(0,n)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Use this field to define the FR(0,n) variable as you would in acall to EN1^DIP that included BY(0).  If defined, the value will beused as the starting point as FileMan sequences through the globalarray referenced by BY(0) at this subscript level (n). Values are not transformed, so enter the internal form just as itis stored in the global array.  A date, for example, would be 2960829,not Aug 29, 1996. Don't attempt to use the at-sign (@) to include records with nullvalues (as can be done in ordinary sorts).  Only use values that canbe compared with actual data in this subscript of the global arrayreferenced by BY(0).  (The only records that can be selected are onesthat exist in this global array.  A record with a null value for thissubscript would exist in the data file but not in this array and thuscan't be selected.)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>to(0,n)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Use this field to define the TO(0,n) variable as you would in acall to EN1^DIP that included BY(0).  If defined, the value will beused as the ending point as FileMan sequences through the globalarray referenced by BY(0) at this subscript level (n). Values are not transformed, so enter the internal form just as itis stored in the global array.  An inverse date, for example,would be 7039268, not 7/31/96.  Do not attempt to use @ to selectrecords with null values for this subscript.</td></tr><tr><td>3.1</td><td>dispar(0,n) piece one</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Just as when setting the first piece of DISPAR(0,n) in a programmercall that includes BY(0) when calling EN1^DIP, this field can holdthe sort qualifiers for page breaks (#) or rankings (!).   The # and/or ! are the only qualifiers that can be used.  Others,such as + for subtotals, cannot be used.</td></tr><tr><td>3.2</td><td>dispar(0,n) piece two</td><td>1;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>As when defining the second piece of DISPAR(0,n) in a programmercall that includes BY(0) when calling EN1^DIP, this field can holdthe sort qualifiers that normally appear after a sort-by field ininteractive mode.  The ones that can be used are as follows:  ;""         to have the subheader appear ;"caption"  to give the subheader a caption ;Ln         to left-justify the subheader to n characters ;Cn         to start the display in the nth column ;Sn         to skip n lines before each subheader If this field is null, subheaders are supressed (@ is assumed).</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>dispar(0,n,out)</td><td>2;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>As when defining DISPAR(0,n,"OUT") for a call to EN1^DIP that includesBY(0), enter M code that will transform the sort-by value for this subscript (n) when it is output (e.g. printed).  At the timethe code is executed the untransformed value of the subscript will be inY.  The code should put the transformed value back into Y. For example, for an inverse date, S:Y Y=99999999-Y S Y=$$FMTE^XLFDT(Y)"</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><div class='error'><p>Error: Invalid Global File Type: .4011624</p></div></div>
