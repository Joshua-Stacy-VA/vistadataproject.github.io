Certain issuing patterns bypublishers do not lend themselves to the establishment of aprediction pattern, most notably those quarterly publicationswhich are labeled with seasonal designations such as spring,winter, etc.  In order for a prediction pattern to be created,the serials title must be dated in a MM/YY or MM/DD/YY format.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>predict pat seq</td><td>4;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows for the input of the alpha-numeric codewhich identifies the prediction pattern and puts it intoa sequence with all other patterns.

The alpha charactersidentify the underlying frequency, such as A- monthly,K- 8 times per year, etc.  The numbers place the predictionpattern in the proper sequence within its frequency typeaccording to months, days, number of volumes, etc.,according to a predetermined format for the PREDICTION PATTERNNAME.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>month</td><td>5;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows the input of the month or monthsinvolved in the construction of the specific predictionpattern.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>wom/dow</td><td>5;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is to create a pattern for those serials titles whichare issued on a certain day of the week for a certain week ofthe month, for example, Friday of the third week.
