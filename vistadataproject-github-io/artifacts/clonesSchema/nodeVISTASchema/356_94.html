In addition, the attending and resident providers can beidentified in this file.  If attending and resident providers areentered then they are assume to be entered completely for an episodeof care being tracked.  If no provider other than admitting physicianis entered then the providers and attending from MAS will be consideredto the the correct providers.  Because QM data may be extracting thisdata on the national roll-up, it is necessary to correctly identify theattending physician. Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>date of change(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the first day that this provider is responsible for care forthe patient.

If the admission to acure care does not meet URcriteria, it is important to track the admitting physician. The attending physician is the physician responsible for the care ofthe patient, more than one physician may be the attending. The provider is the physician directly providing patient care.  Inaffiliated hospitals this can be a resident or intern who is not necessarily responsible (the attending is responsible). Because UR reviews are done every day, it is important to be ableto accurately track attendings and providers related to care thatdoes not meet critea.   </td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
