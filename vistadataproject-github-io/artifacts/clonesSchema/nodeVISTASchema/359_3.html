Under normal circumstancesvery few errors should occur, however, if they do occur, the workstation software (client side) will be notified and the error can be found inthis file and if possible resolved.  Normally each error represents onepiece of data that was ignored by the server software and can easilybe entered into PCE using one of the data entry methodologies. Entries in this file may be deleted after any corrective action thatneeds to be taken is complete.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>error date/time(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the date and time that the error occured.
