Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS. SIRS is a widespread inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinicalinsults. This syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two or more of the following:   - Temp >38 degrees C or <36 degrees C   - HR >90 bpm   - RR >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mmHg(<4.3 kPa)   - WBC >12,000 cell/mm3, <4000 cells/mm3, or >10% immature (band)      forms   - Anion gap acidosis: this is defined by either:      [Na + K] - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is       greater than 16, then an anion gap acidosis is present.     or      Na - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is greater      than 12, then an anion gap acidosis is present.  and one of the following:   - positive blood culture   - clinical documentation of purulence or positive culture from any      site thought to be causative 2. Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock: Sepsis is considered severe when it is associated with organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Report this variable if the patient has the clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS or sepsis AND documented organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Examples oforgan dysfunction include: oliguria, acute alteration in mental status,acute respiratory distress. Examples of circulatory dysfunction include: hypotension, requirement of inotropic or vasopressor agents. * For the patient that had sepsis preoperatively, worsening of any of the above signs postoperatively would be reported as a postoperative sepsis. Examples: A patient comes into the emergency room with signs of sepsis - WBC 31, Temperature 104.

Postoperatively his WBC andTemperature are trending down.  POD#1 WBC 24, Temp 102   POD#2 WBC 14, Temp 100   POD#3 WBC 10, Temp 99 This patient does not have postoperative sepsis as his WBC and Temperature are improving each postoperative day.  Patient comes into the ER with s/s of sepsis - WBC 31, Temp 104.

The patient is also noted to be dehydrated and febrile. He is disoriented to place and time and seems confused. His family reports that he has been oriented and alert prior to the fall. This patient has an impaired sensorium on the basis of his confusion and disorientation.  Example: A patient is admitted to the general surgical service with biliary sepsis and high spiking fevers.

A patient with primary breast cancer with positive nodes   in the axilla AND liver metastases does qualify, because the tumor   has spread to the axilla and other major organs.  - A patient with colon cancer and no positive nodes or distant    metastases does NOT qualify.

The branches to the right atrium (sinus node artery) and right ventricle (conus branch and acute marginal branches) are commonly ignored when describing coronary artery disease. However, the right coronary artery is the most common source for the posteriordescending coronary artery and often gives-off branches to theposterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle.

Both the anatomy andnomenclature for describing the circumflex coronary artery can be confusing -- in part, because of the marked variability from patient topatient. The true circumflex lies in the groove separating the leftatrium from the left ventricle (A-V groove) for a variable distancefollowing its origination from the left main coronary artery.Typically, it gives-off one or more branches that leave the A-V grooveto supply the posterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle. Theseare known as marginal branches. A few patients have a branch to theposterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle arising exactly at the bifurcation of the left main coronary artery into the left anteriordescending coronary artery and the circumflex coronary artery. Strictlyspeaking, this vessel is neither a diagonal branch of the left anteriordescending coronary artery nor a marginal branch of the circumflexcoronary artery. This is often called the "ramus intermedius" or"trifurcation branch". If there is no obstruction of these coronaryarteries, indicate zero.

The tumor has spread    to a site other than the primary site, but does not have widespread   metastases. A patient with primary breast cancer with positive    nodes in the axilla AND liver metastases does qualify, because the   tumor has spread to the axilla and other major organs.   - A patient with colon cancer and no positive nodes or distant    metastases does NOT qualify. A patient with colon cancer and    several local lymph nodes positive for tumor, but no other evidence   of metastatic disease does NOT qualify. A patient with colon cancer   with liver metastases and/or peritoneal seeding with tumor does   qualify.  - A patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate confined to the    capsule does NOT qualify.

Radiofrequency or a cryo-ablation probe isused either inside or outside of the pulmonary vein ostia to destroythe foci.  It can be performed with or without resection of the atrialappendage and includes no incision or minimal incisions to the leftatrium, rather than the extensive atrial surgical procedure conductedfor the full Maze.
