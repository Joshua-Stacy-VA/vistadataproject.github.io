This field will be automatically generated by the system andassumes users will record inventory transactions in a timely manner.It is one of the primary key fields and is also recorded on the barcode.It is a requirement that the date@time stamp should have a unique valuefor any given HCPCS. The reason for this is that HCPCS will also berecorded on an item's barcode and it is important that barcodes will notneed changing if a site is integrated at some time in the future.Given the date&time stamp and HCPCS fields it is possible to generate atransactions IEN using the appropriate cross-reference.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>sequence</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is a sequence number starting at 1 and incremented by 1 foreach transaction which has the same HCPCS and DATE&TIME STAMP fields. Thissituation should be very rare and only occurs at all after siteintegrations. The HCPCS, DATE&TIME STAMP and SEQUENCE fields together makeup the primary key for this file.The rationale behind this design is to allow the HCPCS and DATE&TIME STAMPto be printed as a barcode for automated data entry on a stock issue form.Fileman IENs will be derived from appropriate cross-references and, ofcourse, these IENs can all change if a site is integrated.On the rare occasions where there is more than 1 SEQUENCE numberassociated with a HCPCS and DATE&TIME STAMP the user will have to beprompted to select from a list of transactions. We see no way round thisinconvenience but hopefully it will be extremely rare!</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>transaction type</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:RECEIPT<br/>2:ORDER<br/>3:PATIENT ISSUE<br/>4:ISSUE TO LAB<br/>5:RETURN TO VENDOR<br/>6:WRITE OFF<br/>7:TRANSFER<br/>8:RETURN IN<br/>9:RECONCILE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field records the transaction type, which can be one of thefollowing... Receipt - for receiving items into stock. Order - for when a stock item has been ordered from the vendor. Patient Issue - for when a stock item is issued to a veteran. Issue to Lab - this transaction should be used for those items which are               used by the labs to fabricate items. An example would be a               bag of plaster which could be used for treating several               patients. Return to Vendor - if an item has been received into stock but is later                   returned to the vendor for some reason, then this                   transaction type should be used. Write Off - use this transaction type when an item is removed from stock            and scrapped. Transfer - for transferring stock between locations. The transaction           quantity will be -ve for the 'transfer from' location. Return In - for when a veteran returns a stock item previously issued. Reconcile - for when a stock check is done.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>quantity</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The number of items associated with the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>value</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The dollar value of the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>comment</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>A short comment can be entered, if required for a particular transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>user</td><td>0;9</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td></td><td>This field points to the New Person file (200) and identifies the personresponsible for creating the transaction on the system.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>hcpcs item(+)</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is the HCPCS ITEM field held on the 661.12 sub field  of thePROSTHETIC HCPCS file (661.1).The value held is the sub file's IEN not the ITEM text field.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>vendor</td><td>0;12</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="440.html">440</a></td><td></td><td>This field is the FMS VENDOR CODE held on the VENDOR file (440).
