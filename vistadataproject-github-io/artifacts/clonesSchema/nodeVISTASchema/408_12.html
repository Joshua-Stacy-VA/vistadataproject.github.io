Demographic data (name, SSN, date of birth, and sex)can be found in either the PATIENT file (if the relation is a veteran)or in the INCOME PERSON file (if the relation is not a veteran).  Asingle individual may be entered in this file more than once of thatindividual is related to more than one veteran.  An example would bea spouse that was a veteran.  One entry would exist for the veteranhimself and one as the husband of his veteran wife.  This would alsohold true for children of two veteran parents. This file relates all relations for a veteran to the veteran.  Theserelations are date sensitive and can be activated and inactivated. Data in this file is utilized by the income screening and means testportions of MAS.  It should be edited through those applications andnot through direct access through VA FileMan.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>patient(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the name of the patient to which this individual is related (even ifit is the patient himself/herself).</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>relationship(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="408_11.html">408.11</a></td><td></td><td>Enter in this field the persons relationship to the veteran.
