The labels are subfields of this one parameter.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field is the name field.  There should only be oneentry in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>records to purge</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NONE<br/>1:COMPLETED<br/>2:ALL<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter whether you want the background purge option to purge all recordsfrom form tracking older that the number of days specified in the fieldFORM TRACKING RETENTION DAYS, or completed records, or no records.   After purging records from form tracking, the purge utility will checkto see if all forms for inactive form definitions have been received.If so, then the form definition and Form Specification for that formmay be deleted.  Purging ALL Form Tracking entries will cause theform definition and form specification to be deleted for forms thathave not yet been completed.  Once the form definition is deletedthe form specification can not be recreated in DHCP, if it does notexist on the AICS workstation the form can not be recognized.This is generally not a problem as entries must be at least 60 daysold to purge.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>form tracking retention days</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the number of days to retain form tracking information after itis no longer used.  The AICS purge utility will delete entries inthe Encounter Form Definition file (357.95), the Encounter Form Trackingfile (357.96), and the Form Specification file the number of days </td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>default data entry form</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="357.html">357</a></td><td></td><td>This is the form definition that will be used during manual data entryif no form for a clinic is defined.  If this is not filled in thenthe PRIMARY CARE SAMPLE (2.1) form in the tool kit will be used as thedefault form.  If that form has been deleted then provider, procedure     and diagnosis will be asked but no quick entry features will be available.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>print forms for inpatients</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter 'Yes' if you want encounter forms printed for Inpatients or 'No'if no enounter forms for inpatients should be printed.  If this fieldis null, it will be treated as a 'Yes' and encounter forms for inpatientswill be printed. This parameter affects all options that print forms for appointmentsfor a clinic, it does not affect printing individual forms.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>make appointment in data entry</td><td>0;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter 'Yes' if you wish for users at your site to be able to make a followup appointment during data entry of an encounter form or enter 'No' if youdo not wish to see that prompt.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>pass data to pce</td><td>0;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:BACKGROUND<br/>1:BACKGROUND/W VALIDATION<br/>2:FOREGROUND/NO DISPLAY<br/>3:FOREGROUND/WITH DISPLAY<br/></td><td></td><td>Choose how data captured in the AICS EF Data Entry Options should bepassed to PCE.  The data entry options use the same mechanism to updatePCE (and scheduling) as the scanning software.  Background refers tosending data to PCE by using TaskMan to create a separate process so theuser may continue working.  Foreground refers to sending the data to PCE inreal time.  The choices for data entry are:      Background - This is the fastest method for the user.  No validation        of the data is done by PCE and no display there is no display of       results.    Background with Validation -  This is the next fastest way.  The data       is validated with PCE prior to passing in the background.  If the       data does not validate, the user will be shown the error messages       and allowed to re-edit the data.    Foreground with no display of data - Data is always validated when        passed to PCE in the foreground. If the data does not validate,       the user will be shown the error messages and allowed to re-edit       the data.   Foreground with display - This is the slowest method but will be most       useful as a validation tool.  The data sent to PCE is redisplayed      after it has been been accepted by PCE.  Any differences in what      was supposed to be sent and what was actually sent should be noticable.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>fill % for bubbles</td><td>0;8</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter a number between 0 and 99 that represents the percentage offill required for a bubble to be considered as checked.  Entering a zerowill leave the determination up to Paper Keyboard.  If this field is leftblank AICS will use 20% as the amount of fill required. This field corresponds to the Threshold % field in the Metric dialog boxin Paper Keyboard.  Modifying this field will only affect new forms.Existing form specification files will not be affected.  To modify an existing form specification file it must be deleted from the workstation and the corresponding entry in file 359.2 must be deleted.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>background % for bubbles</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter a number between 0 and 99 that represents the percentage of background fill in a bubble that can exist before Paper Keyboardwill consider any markings in the bubble.  If this field is left blankthen AICS will use 5%.  Entering a zero leaves the determination upto Paper Keyboard. This field corresponds to the Background % field in the Metric dialog box.Entering a small value prevents small dots on the page from appearing ascheck marks.  The value of this field should always be less than the valuefor the FILL % FOR BUBBLES field. Editing this field will not affect any current form specification files,only files created after changing this value.  To modify a current formspecification you must delete the file from the workstation and remove thecorresponding entry from file 359.2.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>days to print 1010f</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>If you have chosen to print a 1010F with your encounter forms, this is thenumber of days between the expiration of a means test and the appointment date before that you want to print 1010F's for.  For example, if this fieldis set to 30, then 1010F's will print for means tests that are due to expire within 30 days of the appointment.  1010F's will also print if theyare in a required status.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>days to retain pending pages</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the number of days that entries in Form Tracking will be retainedin a Pending Pages status.  The automatic encounter form job will checkthis value each night and attempt to pass forms in this status to PCEafter they have been in this status for the specified number of dayspast the encounter date.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>reduce handprint recognition size</td><td>0;12</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>When scanning, some sites have problems with the outline of hand printfields not being removed completely.  This results in "phantom" entriesbeing detected by Paper Keyboard and user validation during recognition.This problem is caused by the interaction of 3 different features, thedarkness of the print, the size of the recognition area, and the lightintensity of the scanner.  This field allows you to reduce the size ofthe recognition area which may assist in moving the "phantom" outside ofthe recognition area.  This information is then computed and stored inthe FormSpec file on the VistA server and the workstation.To leave the recognition area the same size as before AICS v3.0 patch IBD*3*25 enter a zero.  The default value of the field if there isno entry is 5.  The maximum value of the field is 8.  Reducing the sizewill move all 4 sides of the box in by .1mm times the number entered.If you are having the "phantom" problem, you should also check the value in fields DARKNESS OF DOTS and CLOSENESS OF DOTS in this file.These fields allow for printing the hand print field outlines at alighter value.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>darkness of dots</td><td>0;13</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>When scanning, some sites have problems with the outline of hand printfields not being removed completely.  This results in "phantom" entriesbeing detected by Paper Keyboard and user validation during recognition.This problem is caused by the interaction of 3 different features, the   darkness of the print, the size of the recognition area, and the lightintensity of the scanner.  This field allows sites to determine the Pen Width value of the dots of handprint fields and bubbles when printing onlaser printers.  Reducing the pen width below 12 will make the dotssmaller thus making it more likely for the dots to disappear during the scanning process.To leave the dot size the same as before AICS v3.0 patch IBD*3*25 enter a 12.  The default value of the field if there is no entry is 12.  The minimum value of this field is 9, the maximum value is 15.Changing this value immediately affects the printing of encounter forms.Test changes by changing the value one number at a time and then viewingthe form.If you are having the "phantom" problem, you should also check the valuesin fields CLOSENESS OF DOTS and REDUCE HANDPRINT RECOGNITION SIZE in thisfile.  These fields allow for printing the hand print field outlines at a lighter value and reduce the size of the area used for recognition.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>closeness of dots</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>When scanning, some sites have problems with the outline of hand printfields not being removed completely.  This results in "phantom" entriesbeing detected by Paper Keyboard and user validation during recognition.This problem is caused by the interaction of 3 different features, the   darkness of the print, the size of the recognition area, and the lightintensity of the scanner.  This field allows sites to determine the percentage of fill (closeness of dots) that is used to print handprint field outlines and bubbles when using a laser printer.To leave the closeness of dots the same as before AICS v3.0 patch IBD*3*25 enter a 25.  The default value of the field if there is no entry is 25.  The minimum value of this field is 20, the maximum value is 30.Changing this value immediately affects the printing of encounter forms.Reducing the closeness of dots below 25 will allow Paper Keyboard to moreeasily remove the dots.  Test changes by changing the value one number ata time and then viewing the form.If you are having the "phantom" problem, you should also check the valuesin fields DARKNESS OF DOTS and REDUCE HANDPRINT RECOGNITION SIZE in thisfile.  These fields allow for printing of the hand print field outlines at a lighter value and improve recognition during scanning.</td></tr><tr><td>1.01</td><td>purge notification mail group</td><td>1;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_8.html">3.8</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of the mail group that should receive the automaticnotification of purge results.  Purge results are sent every timethe AICS purge runs, regardless of whether or not the auto purge ormanual purge is run. If no group is entered then no message will be sent.  Results arealways stored in the AICS PURGE LOG file (357.08) and can be reviewedat any time.</td></tr><tr><td>1.02</td><td>stop defaulting c/o date/time</td><td>1;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>If checkout date/time is not present on the Encounter Form, the softwarewill automatically default a checkout date/time to that of the scan date/time.  If you do not wish to default the checkout date/time, you shouldenter 'YES' in this field to stop the automatic default.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>print mgr's queuing param name</td><td>Q;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="357_091.html">357.091</a></td><td></td><td>This field is a multiple.  This is the name of the parameter group for the printing of encounter forms.  The encounter form backgroundprint job will loop through all of the parameter groups andprint the forms for the clinics that are under this parameterthe print job.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
