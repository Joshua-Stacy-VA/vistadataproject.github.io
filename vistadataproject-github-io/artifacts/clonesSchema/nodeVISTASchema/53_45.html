Some of these parameters (fields) can be set by theusers, and others can only be set by an Inpatient supervisor.  (A supervisoris a user who has been assigned the 'PSJU MGR' security key.)  This file also contains fields that are used as temporary storage of dataduring order entry/edit.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PSJ</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>inpatient user(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td></td><td>  This is a user for whom the Inpatient Medications package can be tailored.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>may select dispense drugs</td><td>0;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>  Unless the user is a pharmacist, the user can be set up to allow UnitDose orders to be entered by Orderable Item or Dispense Drug.

If this is setto 'NO' (or not set), this clerk/technician can only mark orders for hold/unhold, and only a pharmacist or nurse can hold/unhold the orders.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>allow user to d/c orders</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>  If this is set to 'YES', this ward clerk/pharmacy technician may actuallycancel patients' Inpatient orders.

If adevice is entered here, it will be used instead of any device selected forthe ward or pharmacy to print label created by this user.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>type of user</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>3:PHARMACIST<br/>2:PHARMACY TECHNICIAN<br/>1:NURSE<br/>0:WARD STAFF<br/></td><td></td><td>  This is used to define what type of user this user is.

TheREGULAR order entry is the full set of prompts for the entry of an order,after which the user is shown a full view of the order and allowed to take immediate action on the order. The ABBREVIATED order entry gives the user fewer prompts for the entry of an order, after which the user is shown a full view of the order and is allowed to take immediate action on the order.The WARD order entry gives the user the same prompts as the ABBREVIATEDorder entry, but then gives a brief view of the entered order and doesnot allow immediate action to be taken on the order.  No entry here is the same as selecting REGULAR order entry.   This does not affect the entering of Inpatient Medication orders throughthe Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) package.  This is only for theentering of Unit Dose orders through the Unit Dose Order Entry option andthe Inpatient Order Entry option.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>label printer pointer</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td></td><td>This is a device to which labels created by this user will print.
