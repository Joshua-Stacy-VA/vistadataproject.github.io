The INPUT VARIABLEfields are for documentation purposes and to verify that the propervariables are defined. Data will be exchanged between the encounter formutilities and other packages by putting the data in a predefined location.The first part of the subscript is always be ^TMP("IB",$J,"INTERFACES".For output routines, but not selection routines, the fourth subscript isbe the patient DFN. The next subscript is the name of the PackageInterface. For single valued data and record valued data there is noadditional subscript. For interfaces returning a list there is oneadditional subscript level, the number of the item on the list. Forword processing type data the data will be in FM word-processing format,i.e., the final subscripts will be ...1,0),...2,0),...3,0), etc.these items of data can have its own entry in the Package Interface file,but by using the same entry point there is a savings because all of thedata on that node can be obtained at once. The routines that invoke theentry point keep track of the entry points already invoked so they arenot repeated.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td> The name of the Package Interface.
