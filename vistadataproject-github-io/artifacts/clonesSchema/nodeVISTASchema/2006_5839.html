Imaging is a subscriber to the protocolentry GMRC EVSEND OR (Consults event sent to OE/RR) and evaluates all HL7message segments received from this protocol.  When an ORC message segmentis received for a signed result (signed TIU note) then a module is calledto lookup the entry in this file for possible matches and once found willupdate the image entry in the Image file with it's associated parentreport and file the image pointer in the associated parent report.  Thematched entry is then deleted from this file.  </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>file number(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>123:Consults/Requests<br/></td><td>B</td><td>The value of this field is a pointer to a file. Since this field may point only to a very limited numberof files, the datatype for this field is a SET OF CODES,rather than a pointer to the File of Files. Currently, the only possible value is 123 (Consults).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>entry number(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a pointer into a file. The file number of the file into which this field pointsis stored as the value of field FILE NUMBER. Since this value is not a "variable pointer", nor a "normal pointer",the data type of this field is NUMBER, not POINTER.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>image(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2005.html">2005</a></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a pointer into the Image File (2005). The image that is being pointed to is usually the group-parentof the group of images that is linked to the entity in thetemporary file. (When the image group consists of one single image,that image won't have a "group parent", and this fieldwill point to the image itself.)</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
