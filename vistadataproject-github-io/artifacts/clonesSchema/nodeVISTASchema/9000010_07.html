POV is an abbreviation for "Purpose ofVisit" (descriptive name used by IHS) or "Problem of Visit" (descriptivename used by VA). The V POV file is used to store clinical data related to the "purpose ofvisit" or "problem of visit", (POV). This is the provider's definition ofwhat diagnosis to use to represent the patient care given at the visit.The POV entry is not the patient's "Chief Complaint" text.  It is thediagnosis as defined by the provider which will have an ICD Diagnosiscode related to it to support Clinical needs and additionally supportAdministrative functions too such as Billing, Workload, and DSS.   There should be at least one "purpose of visit" (descriptive name used byIHS) or one "problem of visit" (descriptive name used by the VA) in the VPOV file for each patient visit whether it is an inpatient, outpatient orfield visit, and regardless of the discipline of the provider (i.e.dental, CHN, mental health, etc.). There is no limit to the number ofPOV's that can be entered for a patient for a given encounter.  At IHS facilities, POV's are generated automatically for this file attime of discharge from the Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) system.POV's are entered in narrative form, and coded automatically to the appropriate ICD diagnosis code. Physician entered narrative which modifiesdiagnosis, such as "doubtful, suspect, resolved" are entered by the dataentry person in the MODIFIER field.  Narrative qualifiers, such as "nothealing well", "date of onset", "severe" etc.. are stored in the NARRATIVEQUALIFIER field.  STAGE is used only as a local option.  The file containspointers to the IHS Patient file, and visit file, and data must exist inboth of these files for this visit before a POV can be entered here. At VA facilities, POV is used as an abbreviation for "Problem of Visit",or the problem treated at the visit.  POV's are primarily createdfor clinic visits from 3 sources:  1) The scheduling checkout process, in which case the informationcollected about the POV is limited to the ICD Diagnosis code.  Theprovider narrative becomes the ICD narrative from the ICD Diagnosis file.  2) The Encounter Form automated data scanning (AICS package).  In thiscase the provider narrative is the terminology defined by the clinician torepresent the diagnosis on the encounter form. The AICS package, or otherautomated data capture tool, is able to pass the narrative and the ICDDiagnosis.  If the problem treated at the visit was a pre-existing problemfrom the patient's "Problem List", the related problem entry is alsostored in the POV record. (The Problem List orientation is not utilized byIHS.)  3) The manual data entry process for encounter form data not collectedvia automated data capture.  This process is the most like the process IHS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>pov(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="80.html">80</a></td><td>B</td><td>POV is an abbreviation for "Purpose of Visit".  Since Purpose of Visit isoften confused with "Chief complaint", another abbreviation might betterbe  "Problem of Visit".  This is the Provider's conclusion about what wastreated at the visit.  The Provider should be able to indicate a preferrednarrative for what was treated and an ICD Diagnosis code.  If the problemtreated is from the Problem List, then the problem list entry informationcan be used for the "Problem of Visit" entry.  The provider canalternatively have this information automatically captured via scannedEncounter Forms (e.g., AICS - the VA's Encounter Form Data Capturepackage). At VA facilities, the ICD Diagnosis is screened by Inactive Code and itmust be appropriate for the Patient's age and sex. At IHS facilities, the ICD Diagnosis is screened by Inactive Code,appropriate for the Patient's age and sex, and Not "E" codes.</td></tr><tr><td>.019</td><td>icd narrative</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the computed diagnosis narrative that is defined in the ICD Diagnosisfile for the ICD Diagnosis code identified in the POV (.01) field.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>patient name(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9000001.html">9000001</a></td><td></td><td>This is the patient whose problem or diagnosis was treated.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>visit(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9000010.html">9000010</a></td><td>AD</td><td>The encounter entry in the Visit file that is associated with thisproblem treated. In IHS facilities, this is the date and time the visit actually occurred. In VA facilities, this is the data and time of the clinic appointment forthe patient in the Scheduling package, or the date and time the encounteroccurred if there was no appointment. By using the appointment date andtime, clinic activity can be captured for clinical use as well as beused for billing and workload information by the appropriate VA packages.If the visit was for a walk-in, an appointment should be entered inScheduling first in order to have the clinical information also be usedfor the administrative uses. Non-clinic appointment encounters can be entered, but the clinical POVinformation is not accepted for billing.   The patient encounter can be the result of an inpatient encounter.

The ICD Diagnosis code in the POV (.01)field should be the code that "most closely" represents the providersnarrative. In IHS facilities, this narrative is entered by data entry clerks. In VA facilities, this narrative may be entered manually or derived from:1) the ICD Diagnosis text from the ICD Diagnosis file (Schedulinginterface)2) the text defined on Encounter Forms when defining the most commondiagnosis treated for a clinic (AICS or other automated data capture)3) the Problem list entries' "provider narrative", captured from theActive Problem list being checked off for problems treated at theencounter on an Encounter Form (AICS or other automated data capture).</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>modifier</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>C:CONSIDER<br/>D:DOUBTFUL<br/>F:FOLLOW UP<br/>M:MAYBE, POSSIBLE, PERHAPS<br/>O:RULE OUT<br/>P:PROBABLE<br/>R:RESOLVED<br/>S:SUSPECT, SUSPICIOUS<br/>T:STATUS POST<br/></td><td></td><td>(Optional) This is how a provider may modify the diagnosis or problemtreated to reflect the status of the diagnosis as of thisvisit.
