DO NOT edit data in this filewith VA File Manager. This file was introduced with v1.5 of Integrated Billing inconjunction with the automation of bills for Means Testcharges.  The file is used to create and maintain billing clocks inwhich Means Test patients may be charged co-payment and per diemcharges for Hospital or Nursing Home Care, as well as outpatientvisits.  This file was initially populated by the Means Test dataconversion that took place when v1.5 was installed.  Entries aresubsequently updated and created by Integrated Billing. Entries in this file should not be deleted.  Billing clocks whichare not correct will be cancelled, and new clocks may be added. Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>reference number(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field consists of the station number concatenated with the internalnumber of the entry.
