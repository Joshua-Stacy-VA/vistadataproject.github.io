The filter logic is coded in the routineLRCAPV3. This routine controls/filter which workload codes should beplaced into this file. Laboratory Site file has a field which stop or starts the collectionof workload data for DSS purposes. Field COLLECT WKLD LOG FILE DATA(#616) of the LABORTORY SITE FILE (#69.9) should be edited as required. This file has been converted to be used exclusively by DSS softwareto collect laboratory workload for DSS defined products. DSS softwareis responsible for removing the entries from this file based on theirtime table and file size.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>seq number(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>  This field is simply to index the file.
