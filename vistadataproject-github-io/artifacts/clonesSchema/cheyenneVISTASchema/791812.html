The file contains information specific to eachbatch, such as the status of the batch and the pointer to the transmissionmessage. This is a dynamic file whose entries are deleted as part of thepurge process when all orders in the batch are no longer active. When a transmission batch is closed, all information needed by the DDC foreach order is gathered and stored in the Transmission Batch File in theexact format that is sent in the mail message to the DDC. This informationis stored in the "H" node of the file which is a non-standard node. The"H" node has been made non-standard in order to conserve space in thetransmission message. Data definitions for this file are distributed with the ROES. No data isdistributed.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>entry date/time(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the date and time that the order batch was created.
