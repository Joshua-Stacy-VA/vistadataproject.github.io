A stationcan only have one site defined and multiple divisional sites are notcurrently supported.This identifies charges or events to a particular site in the event thatinformation is shared or sent to a centralized system.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>suppress rights & obligations</td><td>0;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Suppression of Rights and Obligations for RX copayment and Means Testbills can be accomplished by setting this parameter to 'YES'.

Some patients may want to have verydetailed information about any RX copay charges on their statement,while others may require brief information.  This parameter will bethe default for ALL patients and will define the amount of informationdisplayed on the patient statement. A second related parameter can be defined for each patient that willover-ride this site parameter.  For example, if a site decides to haveall their patients receive 'brief' information for RX copay charges, thenthis parameter should be set to 'BRIEF'.  However, a particular patientmay request more detailed information, in which case, this parametershould remain as BRIEF and the parameter for the patient should be setto DETAILED.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>last event number</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Last number used by event number driver.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>alc (deposits)</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>ALC code as assigned by Financial Management.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>report printer(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This parameter defines the report printer for the AR system.

A patient may have had activity duringa particular month that has left the account balance at zero (ex.,patient got a $2.00 charge and paid it immediately).  The systemwill print this activity to inform the patient on a patient statement.This information, even though the account balance is zero, is printedto confirm the payment was applied correctly and also for reimbursementand 'proof' of payment to insurance companies. However, some sites may wish not to print these statements and providethe information on a 'as-needed' basis.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>date/time system last updated</td><td>0;10</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is set by the system and should not be directly edited.The AR nightly process is suppose to run every night to updateinterest and administrative charges, print patient statements,print UB bills, create refund bills, etc.  This parameter is set whenthis process has completed every night.  If the process does notcomplete, the AR clerk will be warned and IRM should take action toresolve the problem.  If the process does not run to completion, certainevents that must occur may have not be run to completion.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>site statement day</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the day of the month that the site will send statements to CCPC.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>local ccpc statements</td><td>0;12</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NO STATEMENTS TO LOCAL MAIL GROUP<br/>1:SEND STATEMENTS TO LOCAL MAIL GROUP<br/></td><td></td><td>This answer will determine whether the RCCPC STATEMENTS mail group receivesthe CCPC Patient Statement transmission messages that go to the CCPC.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>ccpc start-up date</td><td>0;13</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This date will reflect the first statement date that the waiver rightsstatements are printed.</td></tr><tr><td>2.01</td><td>statement comment 1</td><td>2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>When printing Patient Statements, the site can have pre-defined textprint on the first page of every statement.
