When data is downloaded from a barcode program, the first recordreceived should be the IDENTIFIER of the data being downloaded. Once the IDENTIFIER is known, then the data will stored in theBARCODE DATA multiple (446.42,1) for the appropriate entry.  Afterthe data has successfully been uploaded, then the proper LINETAG (field #.03) and ROUTINE (field #.04) can be tasked to processthe data. NOTE: The Identifier must be a package namespace followed by twocharacters.  For example: If the program handles inventory of formularydrugs for outpatient, the identifier might be 'PSOFM'.  The 'PSO' is theoutpatient namespace and 'FM' is two characters that further describethe type of program.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>post upload routine</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the ANSI-MUMPS routine that will be calleddirectly after a successful upload of data has taken place. This field can also contain a line tag.  The dash (-) is used, insteadof the up-arrow (^) to separate the line tag from the routine.  For example,if the routine that should be called is EN^ENG you would enter EN-ENGin this field.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>data processor routine</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is the ANSI-MUMPS routine that will be tasked to taskmanagerafter data is uploaded from the barcode reader.  This routine willbe responsible for the processing of data in the BARCODE DATA multiple(data upload from the barcode reader). This field can also contain a line tag.  The dash (-) is used, insteadof the up-arrow (^) to separate the line tag from routine.  For example,if the routine that should be called is EN^ENG you would enter EN-ENGin this field.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>time to queue routine</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the time of day that processing of data for thisentry should take place.  For example, if 1AM is entered into this field,then any data that needs to be processed for this entry will not take placeuntil 1AM.  This means that users could be allowed to upload datafrom a barcode reader during anytime of the day, but allows the localsite to use this field to specify what time of the day the data shouldbe processed. If this field is blank, then the processing of data will be immediate. NOTE: This field contains military time only.  If, for example, 3pm is       entered, this will be converted to 1500.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>is device required ?</td><td>0;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field controls whether or not the user, after uploaded data tothis file entry, is prompted for a device to task the processing. For example, some programs that process barcode data from this filewill require a printer.  If this field is set to 1 (YES), then the userwill be prompted for a device.  If this field is set to 0 (NO), then theuser will not be prompted for a device and the job will run as abackground job with no device associated with it.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>purge days</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is the maximum number of days that the DATE/TIME OF DATAUPLOAD data should exist on the computer system. For example: If this field is 20, any data that may have been uploadedover 20 days ago for this entry will be automatically deleted.  Sincebarcode data is usually 'processed' within a day or two, it is notnecessary to keep this information for a long period of time.  It isrecommended to keep this data for at least 7 days incase trouble-shootingis necessary. If no data is entered for this field, the default is 7 days.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>last data purge flag</td><td>0;8</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is a flag set by the computer.  It is updated by thecomputer as a means to keep track of when the next purge is scheduledto run or was last run.  The purging of data is handled automaticallyand does not need to be run or queued to run by a user.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>specialty commands</td><td>0;9</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="446_6.html">446.6</a></td><td></td><td>This field identifies the specialty commands for the barcode program.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>created by</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td></td><td>This field stores the user creating the barcode program.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>site</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field stores the site creating the barcode program.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>generic downloading?</td><td>0;12</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>   This field determines whether or not a bar code program may be downloadedgenerally (via option PRCT DOWNLOAD BARCODE PROGRAM).   If a bar code program expects that certain parameters will be passed toit from the host system, this field should be blank. Otherwise it may be setto '1'.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>barcode program</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This word-processing field is used for the storage of the barcode programfor the barcode reader.  The program can be downloaded from this fieldinto the barcode reader directly. Comments should be included in the barcode program starting with twocolons.  During downloading of program from this file to the reader,all comments that use two colons will be striped off and not sent tothe barcode reader.  Comments do not need to be resident on the barcodereader itself and it is not recommended since it requires additional memoryto store comments. It is recommended that comments be included at the end of every line ofbarcode program for debugging purposes.  Also, utilities exist to aid youwith comment alignment.  For example, if a 200 line barcode program hascomments at different columns, it makes read-ability of the barcode programvery difficult.  A utility exists to align all comments at a specific(e.g., 30, 35, 40, etc.) column of the barcode program.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>date/time of data upload</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="446_42.html">446.42</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple field stores the date and time of when the data was uploadedfrom a barcode reader and stored in this file.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
