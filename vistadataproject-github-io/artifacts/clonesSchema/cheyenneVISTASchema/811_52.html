Whencombined with the ENDING DATE/TIME, they define a date range inwhich to search for the finding.This can be entered in acceptable FileMan date/time formats andabbreviations. In addition, you may use the abbreviations T-NY orNOW-NY, where N is an integer and Y stands for years.

If USE INACTIVE PROBLEMS is set to YES, then bothactive and inactive problems will be used. Note that this field appliesonly to taxonomy findings.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>within category rank</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field applies only to health factors. In order to understand howit works, you need to understand how health factors work in thereminder evaluation process. If you are not clear about this, see thehealth factor section of the Clinical Reminders Manager Manual.The default behavior is to use only the most recent health factorwithin a category. A problem can arise if there are two or more healthfactors within a category and they both have the same date. (This canhappen if both health factors are given during the same encounter). When the dates are the same, the health factor with the highest WITHINCATEGORY RANK will be used. This is a numerical value like RANKFREQUENCY, with 1 being the highest rank.If WITHIN CATEGORY RANK has the special value of 0, then thecategorization of health factors will be ignored and the health factorwill be treated as a distinct finding.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>ending date/time</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the ending date/time to search for findings. When combinedwith the BEGINNING DATE/TIME, they define a date range in which tosearch for the finding. The ENDING DATE/TIME must be after theBEGINNING DATE/TIME.This can be entered in acceptable FileMan date/time formats andabbreviations. In addition, you may use the abbreviations T-NY or NOW-NY, where N is an integer and Y stands for years. If this is null,then the end date/time will correspond with the date/time of themost recent entry.                                   See the FileMan Getting Started Manual to learn about acceptableFileMan date/time formats and abbreviations.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>mh scale</td><td>0;12</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This applies only to Mental Health Instrument findings. It sets thedefault scale, i.e., the value for V in the Condition.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>condition</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The CONDITION must be written in M code based on the value returned fromthe patient results for the finding. Each type of finding has a specificfield that provides the value available to use in the CONDITION logic.If the finding value is text, enclose the condition value in quotes (e.g., "positive"). If the finding value is numeric, do not use quotes(e.g., 3). An IF statement is used to evaluate the value.  The value is alwaysidentified as V in the statement, regardless of the type of finding. If the condition logic statement evaluates to true, the finding is considered as found (true); otherwise the finding is considered as notfound (false). Relational operators that may be used include: = equals, < less than, >greater than, [ contains, ] follows and ? pattern matches. Logicaloperators may be used to check multiple values: & And, ! Or, ' Not.          Typical examples of M code are as follows:    I V=3 for Education Topic's Level of Understanding = 3    I V="H" for Health Factor's Level/Severity="H"    I ($P(V,"/",1)>140)&($P(V,"/",2)>90) for elevated blood pressure    systolic and diastolic values    I ($P(V,"/",1)>140)!($P(V,"/",2)>90) for elevated blood pressure    systolic or diastolic values    I V["BLACK" for VA-RACE computed finding where race contains BLACK Below is a brief summary for each finding type, the related field to usefor the value, and examples: Finding type                Field Value Used        Example M Code  Drug                       None Education Topic            Level of understanding  I V=3 Exam                       Result                  I V="N" Health Factor              Level/severity          I V="H" Immunization               Series                  I V="P" Laboratory Test            Result Value            I V>130 Mental Health Instrument   Raw score               I V=1 Orderable Item             Status                  I V="complete" Radiology Procedure        None Reminder Computed Finding  Determined by programmer-See Manager Manual Reminder Taxonomy          None Skin Test                  Result                  I V="N" VA Drug Class              None VA Generic                 None Vital Measurement          Rate                    I V>27 For details about allowed CONDITIONS for each finding type, see theClinical Reminders Manager Manual.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>condition case sensitive</td><td>3;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>When CONDITION CASE SENSITIVE is NO, then the CONDITION will beevaluated without regard to case. The default is YES, so that CONDITIONevaluation is case sensitive.  </td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>rxtype</td><td>0;13</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>RXTYPE applies only to drug findings; it controls the search forpatient medications. The possible values for RXTYPE are "I" forinpatient, "N" for non-VA meds, and "O" for outpatient. RXTYPE canbe any combination of these, such as "NO", which will search fornon-VA meds and outpatient medications. If RXTYPE is blank, it isequivalent to a value of "INO".</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>occurrence count</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the maximum number of occurrences of the finding in the daterange to return. If the OCCURRENCE COUNT is input as a positive number,N, up to N of the most recent occurrences will be returned and thefinding will take the value of the most recent occurrence. If theOCCURRENCE COUNT is input as a negative number, then this behavior isreversed. Up to N of the oldest occurrences will be returned and thefinding will take the value of the oldest occurrence in the list.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>use status/cond in search</td><td>3;3</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Give this field a value of "YES" if you want the STATUS LIST and/orCONDITION applied to each result found in the date range for this finding.

The maximum number to retainis specified by the OCCURRENCE COUNT.                                   Note - if the finding has both a STATUS LIST and a CONDITION thestatus check will be made first; the CONDITION will be applied onlyif the finding passes the status check.  </td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>status list</td><td>5;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="811_54.html">811.54</a></td><td></td><td>This field applies to finding types that have an associated status.When the search for patient findings is done, only those findings thathave a status on the list can be true. The allowable values depend onthe finding type. If no statuses are specified, then the default listfor each finding type will be used.
