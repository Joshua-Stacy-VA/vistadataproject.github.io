The name of the baseset that is sent out is "HOSPITAL".  The code will work more efficientlyif the name of the base set of parameters is not changed from "HOSPITAL".</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>top 10 reactions</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="120_841.html">120.841</a></td><td></td><td>A list of reactions for the user to choose from when selecting reactionsfor a patient allergy/adverse reactions.  These will be the ten mostcommon reactions, and modifiable by the site.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>autoverify food/drug/other</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NO AUTOVERIFY<br/>1:AUTOVERIFY DRUG ONLY<br/>2:AUTOVERIFY FOOD ONLY<br/>3:AUTOVERIFY DRUG/FOOD<br/>4:AUTOVERIFY OTHER ONLY<br/>5:AUTOVERIFY DRUG/OTHER<br/>6:AUTOVERIFY FOOD/OTHER<br/>7:AUTOVERIFY ALL<br/></td><td></td><td>This field determines which types of allergies a site wants autoverifiedat the user sign off.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>autoverify observed/historical</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NO AUTOVERIFY<br/>1:AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY<br/>2:AUTOVERIFY OBSERVED ONLY<br/>3:AUTOVERIFY BOTH<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is configurable by the site to allow autoverification ofobserved or historical allergies.</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>autoverify logical operator</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>!:OR<br/>&:AND<br/></td><td></td><td>This field will determine how the Autoverify Food/Drug/Other andAutoverify Observed/Historical parameters relate to each other.  OR meansthat the reaction will be autoverified if it meets the criteria of one ofthe two parameters, while AND means the reaction will be autoverified onlyif it meets the criteria of both parameters.  If this field is left null,the OR condition will be used. For example, if you want to verify only observed drug reactions, you wouldset the Autoverify Food/Drug/Other parameter to AUTOVERIFY FOOD/OTHERand the Autoverify Observed/Historical to AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY, and theAutoverify Logical Operator to OR.  This means that a reaction that hasa type of Food/Other OR is Historical will be autoverified, thus leavingobserved drug reactions to be verified. Another example would be if you wanted to verify all observed reactionsand all drug reactions whether observed or historical.  The parametersshould be set accordingly:  Autoverify Food/Drug/Other to AUTOVERIFYFOOD/OTHER, Autoverify Observed/Historical to AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY andAutoverify Logical Operator to AND.  In this case to be autoverifed, areaction has to have a type of Food/Other AND it must be Historical, allother reactions will need to be verified.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>require originator comments</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates whether the originator will be required to entercomments for an OBSERVED reaction.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>*last dfn converted</td><td>CONV;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The data in this field is the entry number of the Patient file recordwhose data was last converted by the Patient file data conversion.
