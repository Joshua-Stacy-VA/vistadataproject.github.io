The file is used to define the site-specificinformation needed by your laboratory for each accession area.  This includes the type of accession transform (or how often the accession numbers assigned to test performed in that area will be reset to 1), theabbreviation of the area (which becomes part of the accession identifyingthe specimen and test results), the order in which the data for testsperformed in the area will be displayed and other specific information. Definitions of variables used: LRDFN = Internal entry in LR( that is being worked on. LRIDT = Inverse date/time that data is stored at. ^LR(LRDFN,"CH", LRAA = internal value of accession area ^LRO(68, LRAD = date working on in accession area ^LRO(68,LRAA,1, LRAN = accession number working on ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1, LRODT = order date ^LRO(69, LRSN = order entry within date ^LRO(69,LRORD,1,CROSS REFERENCE DESCRIPTION: ^LRO(68,"B",'ACCESSION AREA',LRAA) ^LRO(68,"AC",LRDFN,'DATE RESULTS AVAILABLE','DATA NODE') =    used by the cumulative ^LRO(68,"AD",'LAB SECTION',LRAC) ^LRO(68,"AVS",LRAA,LRAD,LRAN)=LRDFN^LRIDT    used by micro verify by supervisor ^LRO(68,"MI",LRDFN,LRIDT)    used by micro for cumulative report ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,LRAN,"AE")    used for WKLD count   ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,"B",'ENTRY FILE 69',LRAN) ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,"C",'IDENTITY',LRAN) ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,"E",'LAB ARRIVAL TIME',LRAN) ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,"D",'ORDER #',LRAN) ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,"AC",'DATE/TIME COMPLETE',LRAN) ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,"AD",'DATE COMPLETE',LRAN) ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,4,"B",'LAB TEST',LRAN)</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>area(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The accession area of the Lab.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>lr subscript(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>CH:CHEM, HEM, TOX, RIA, SER, etc.<br/>MI:MICROBIOLOGY<br/>EM:ELECTRON MICROSCOPY<br/>SP:SURGICAL PATHOLOGY<br/>CY:CYTOLOGY<br/>AU:AUTOPSY<br/>BB:BLOOD BANK<br/></td><td></td><td>This represents the functional area of the Lab.

The 'L'ong unique accession will always begenerated, it just won't be used in communicating with the instrument, or for barcoding.  Examples of the four accession transformtypes are: Daily/Weekly:   3242889999 where     32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)            4 is the last digit of the year (1994)          288 is the Julian date for Oct 15, 1994         9999 is the 9,999th accession for that date If the 'L'ong version was 3242889999, 'S'hort would be 9999 If the 'L'ong version was 3242880001, 'S'hort would be 1 Yearly:   3294999999 where      32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)            94 is the last two digits of the year (1994)        999999 is the 999,999th accession for that year If the 'L'ong version was 3294999999, 'S'hort would be 999999 If the 'L'ong version was 3294000001, 'S'hort would be 1 Quarterly:   3240499999 where      32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)             4 is the last digit of the year (1994)            04 is the fourth quarter of 1994         99999 is the 99,999th accession for that quarter If the 'L'ong version was 3240499999, 'S'hort would be 99999 If the 'L'ong version was 3240400001, 'S'hort would be 1 Monthly:   3241299999 where      32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)             4 is the last digit of the year (1994)            12 is the twelfth month of 1994         99999 is the 99,999th accession for that month If the 'L'ong version was 3241299999, 'S'hort would be 99999 If the 'L'ong version was 3241200001, 'S'hort would be 1</td></tr><tr><td>.095</td><td>*lab section(+)</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_2.html">62.2</a></td><td>AD</td><td>  THIS FIELD HAS BEEN MARKED FOR DELETION IN FUTURE VERSIONSTHE FIELD LAB DIVISION (#.19) WILL BE USED INSTEAD PER WORKLOADREVISION.</td></tr><tr><td>.097</td><td>non lab accession area</td><td>0;21</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td> This field indicates if this particular accession area is operated byanother service other than Pathology & Laboratory Medicine.

Nurses enteringfinger stick glucose) do not set this field to yes.

Use the numbers 1-9and uppercase letters A-Z to designate the identifier. For example, ifyou enter 99 all accession identifiers for this accession area willstart with 99, e.g. 9923400025. If a single character is used the system will append a leading zero tothe unique identifier generated. No two accession areas can use the same identifier. Changing the identifier should only be performed when accessioning is notoccurring and when a situation requires it since personnel will memorizethis identifier as representing the accesson area. Do NOT switch identifiers between active accession areas since this couldcompromise the uniqueness of the resulting unique identifier (UID). Thesoftware when generating a UID checks for the existence of the UID it willcreate for an accession. If it currently exists the UID being created willhave "00" as the numeric identifier.</td></tr><tr><td>.7</td><td>lock for load/work list build</td><td>.7;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This locks the accession to allow only ONEload/work list to build at a time.</td></tr><tr><td>.8</td><td>lab oos location</td><td>.8;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44.html">44</a></td><td></td><td>Occassion Of Service (OOS)  This field is used for passing data to the PCE API. This API is usedto capture CPT codes for laboratory procedures. Special OOS Hospital locations have been created that are solely used forrecording workload (No count locations). These OOS location all begin with'LAB DIV' in their names. Example of name:LAB DIV 600 OOS ID 108Where 600 is the Station Number from the Institution file (#4).Where 600 is the division Station Number where the work is done.Where 108 is the OOS ID (stop code) for the service doing the work. Note: The stop code could be one assigned to another service, ie Medicine.Stop Codes are not limited to Laboratory 108. The Laboratory Information Manager has special options used to create newOOS locations in HOSPITAL LOCATION file. These options are used when andnew division is established or a new stop code is required. The location names are constructed by the option and should not be alteredusing FileMan. The naming convention is critical to the ability to assignOOS Hospital Locations to Laboratory Accession (#68) file. If a given Accession Area in the Accession file (#68) does not have aLAB OOS LOCATION S LOCATION (#.8) Hospital Location assigned, the DEFAULTLAB OOS LOCATION (#.8) from the LABORATORY SITE (#69.9) file will be used.If the DEFAULT LAB OOS LOCATION field is not defined, no workload will becaptured.</td></tr><tr><td>.9</td><td>user access authorization</td><td>0;14</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="19_1.html">19.1</a></td><td></td><td>If left blank, any lab person may access this accession area.
