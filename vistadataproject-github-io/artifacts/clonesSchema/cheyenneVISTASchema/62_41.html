This 'name' is used as an identifier for the test in all messages sent toand from the instrument.  It is important that the Universal InterfacePC has the name defined in this instrument's configuration exactly asit is here in the auto instrument file, including upper and lower case.This field does NOT have to be the test name, but can be.  The name of this field should not be taken literally, it is used for both uploadingand downloading, uni-directional as well as bi-directional.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>accession area</td><td>2;12</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="68.html">68</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to limit the building of tests on a HL7 Order message.If an accession area is entered then the accession must be from thisaccession area for this test to build on a HL7 Order message.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>specimen</td><td>2;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="61.html">61</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to limit the building of tests on a HL7 Order message.If a specimen is entered then the specimen on the accession must matchfor this test to build on a HL7 Order message. </td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>urgency</td><td>2;14</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_05.html">62.05</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to limit the building of tests on a HL7 Order message.If an urgency is entered then the urgency of the test must match for thistest to build on a HL7 Order message. </td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>routine storage</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This data is triggered by the test field.  It contains the internalstorage location in file 63.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>number of decimal places</td><td>2;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used to modify the result returned by the instrument.  Itis used to force the result to a certain number of decimal places.  Ifthe result has more decimal places than the number entered for this field,the result will be rounded to the number of decimal places specified.  Forexample, if this field's value was '2' and the instrument returned a result of '34.678', the result would be modified to '34.68'.If MUMPS code exists in PARAM 1, it will be executed before any modificationto the result.  If the code in PARAM 1 changes the result such that it isno longer a canonic number, no modification to decimal places will takeplace.To round of the result based on other factors, or in other words - 'On the fly', you can set a variable in PARAM 1 as follows:PARAM 1: S:(CONDITION) LA7XFORM(1)=3Where CONDITION is some MUMPS value that equates to true or false, and 3represents the number of decimal places. 3 is just an example, you can useany number you want, including zero. Consult a programmer before trying this.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>convert result to remark</td><td>2;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field should be set to 'Yes' if you want the result to be convertedto a comment or remark.  If MUMPS code exists in PARAM 1, it will be executed before converting the result to a comment.Be aware that if field 17 'REMOVE SPACES FROM RESULT' is set to 'Yes',the comment will have all spaces removed.To convert the result to a comment based on other factors, or in other words - 'On the fly', you can set a variable in PARAM 1 as follows:PARAM 1: S:(CONDITION) LA7XFORM(2)=1Where CONDITION is some MUMPS value that equates to true or false.

This might be set to 'No' in cases where theinstrument always performs and reports a computed value, but itis not orderable.If there is MUMPS code in PARAM 1, it will be executed regardless ofhow this field is answered.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>ignore results not ordered</td><td>2;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field should be set to 'Yes' if you want to restrict results toonly those tests that were ordered.For example, if an electolytes panel was ordered consisting of:  Sodium  Potassium  Chloride  CO2And the instrument running the sample also reported a BUN result, theBUN would not be reported if this field was set to 'Yes'.To ignore results not ordered based on other factors, or in other words - 'On the fly', you can set a variable in PARAM 1 as follows:PARAM 1: S:(CONDITION) LA7XFORM(5)=1Where CONDITION is some MUMPS value that equates to true or false.  Consulta programmer before trying this.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>remove spaces from result</td><td>2;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>If answered 'Yes' the result from the instrument will be changed so thatit contains NO spaces, e.g.  > 3.2 would be >3.2.  If this test is set upto be converted to a comment (see field 13) the spaces will NOT be removedregardless of how you answer this field. MUMPS code in PARAM 1 willalways be executed before any other transformation of the result takesplace, including the stripping of spaces.To strip spaces conditionally based on other factors, or in other words - 'On the fly', you can set a variable in PARAM 1 as follows:PARAM 1: S:(CONDITION) LA7XFORM(6)=1Where CONDITION is some MUMPS value that equates to true or false.  Consulta programmer before trying this.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>store remarks</td><td>2;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/>2:FINAL ONLY<br/></td><td></td><td>Determines if remarks/comments (HL7 NTE segments) are processed andstored with results. This applies only to remarks/comments thatrelate to a test. Select "NO" to suppress the processing and storing of anyremarks/comments associated with a test result.  If "YES" is selected then all remarks/comments associated with atest result are processed and stored. The default value is "NO". Selecting "FINAL ONLY" will only process and store remarks/commentswhen the associated test result has a status of C,F,U as defined intable 0085 below.

These NTE segments apply to the test, not to the specimen. This field is used in conjunction with field STORE REMARKS (#18)in the CHEM TESTS multiple. If field STORE REMARKS is set to YESthen the value of this field, if any, will be used as the prefixto the remarks when storing the remark in the LAH global. Example: If the text "For test POTASSIUM: " is entered in this fieldand a remark is received associated with this test that states"Specimen hemolyzed" then the remark which will be stored is"For test POTASSIUM: Specimen hemolyzed".</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>store producer's id</td><td>2;9</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Used to determine if a remark(comment) should be created andstored with the results which indicates the producer of thetest result. Used in conjuction with field REMARK PREFIX (#19)which if defined will be the prefix added to the producer'sname/id. This remark is generated from the value, if any, offield OBX-15 Producer's ID from the HL7 ORU result message.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>store reference range</td><td>2;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI):Previous versions of LEDI used this field. Current versions of LEDIdo NOT use this field. References ranges reported by referencelaboratories are always stored with results.   Laboratory Point of Care (POC):Used to determine if reference ranges reported by POC systemwith the results should be processed and stored with the results.Some POC systems have references ranges that are fixed within the POC system and may not be appropriate or accurate on the VistALaboratory system. Set this field to 'YES' to use the reference ranges reported by thePOC system.Set this field to 'NO' to disregard any reference ranges transmittedby the POC system and instead use the reference ranges specified inLABORATORY TEST file (#60) for this test/specimen.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>notify abnormal flags</td><td>2;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Used to determine if an alert and bulletin should be created whenresults are processed with an associated abnormal flag.
