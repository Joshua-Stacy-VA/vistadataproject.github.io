The server extracts certain information and stores it here. A night-time program will then check the file, match it against the install file.  If the current date is past the compliance date for patchinstallation (typically 30 days for regular patches, three days foremergency patches) it will do one of two things:         1.  If the patch has been installed since last run and the parameter file is set in field 3 to delete installed patches, it willdelete the entry from this file, regardless of the number of days in field 2.  If the parameter file is set to leave patches, it is not deleted.         2.  If the patch has NOT been installed, its information will be saved and reported via a mail message to a group. The person(s) who are in charge of monitoring patches at the site orperhaps for the VISN will be responsible for following up on delinquentpatches.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>patch name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the patch as it comes in the mail message.  Examples: RMIM*1*1          DG*5.3*211</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>date of receipt</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>C</td><td>This is the date the patch was received in-house.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>priority</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>m:MANDATORY<br/>e:EMERGENCY<br/></td><td></td><td>The priority assigned to this patch.
