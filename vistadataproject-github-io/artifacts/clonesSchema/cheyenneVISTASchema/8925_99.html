Untilsuch time as electronic signature is enabled, signatures are to be writtenon the chart copy of the TIU document, and provision must be made for TIUdocuments to be marked Signed on Chart.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>characters per line</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This value (default 60) is divided into the total number of 'actual'characters in a given transcribed document to derive the line count forthat document.  By 'actual' characters, we mean all printable ASCIIcharacters, with multiple white space characters stripped. This preventstranscriptionists from "stuffing" line counts by adding white space.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>grace period for purge</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>OUT OF SERVICE.  Purging is disabled. This is the number of days following transcription for which a documentwill be kept, prior to purge. Allowable range is from 90 to 7300 days (20years). NOTE: Progress Notes and their addenda are not subject to purge,regardless of this parameter. IF YOU WANT TO DISABLE PURGING ALTOGETHER,LEAVE THIS PARAMETER EMPTY (or delete any existing value).</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>grace period for signature</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of days following transcription before an author orAttending Physician is notified of a deficiency.  If no grace period isentered, clinicians are not notified of overdue signatures.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>optimize list building for</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>P:performance<br/>S:security<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter determines whether or not TIU list building functionsinvoke business rules, excluding from the list any documents the user isnot authorized to see.  Checking business rules in this way optimizeslist building for security.  It may be costly in terms of performance. When optimized for performance (the default behavior of TIU), businessrules excluding notes from view are bypassed when building lists ofdocuments. NOTE: This applies only to lists: when an unauthorized user attempts toview the contents of a document from the resulting list, he is preventedfrom doing so, with the following explanation: Reviewing Item #1  You may not VIEW this UNSIGNED NURSE'S NOTE. RETURN to continue...</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>suppress review notes prompt</td><td>0;7</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Applies to Progress Notes only.  When this parameter is set to YES, TIUsuppresses the prompt which asks if the user wishes to see availableprogress notes before entering a new note.  This parameter is overriddenby the Personal Preference of same name.  If neither parameter is entered,the Review Notes prompt is NOT suppressed.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>default primary provider</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NONE, DON'T PROMPT<br/>1:DEFAULT, BY LOCATION<br/>2:AUTHOR (IF PROVIDER)<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter determines the behavior of the Primary Provider prompt fora standalone encounter. If the parameter has no value, the prompt has no default. If the parameterhas value 0, the user is not prompted for primary provider. If theparameter has value 1, the default for the Primary Provider prompt is thesite's default provider for the given location.  If the parameter hasvalue 2, the default is the author if the author is a provider; if theauthor is not a provider, the prompt has no default.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>ascii upload source</td><td>0;9</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>H:host file server<br/>R:remote computer<br/></td><td></td><td>Applies only when the ASCII upload protocol is used. This field specifiesthe source from which documents are uploaded. (H)ost indicates to theupload processor that the source of the data is an ASCII host file (VMS orDOS), while (R)emote indicates that the data is read from an ASCII streamcoming to VISTA from a terminal emulator on a remote computer (forexample, an IBM PC or compatible, or an Apple Macintosh).</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>record header signal</td><td>0;10</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a free text tag or signal used by the upload process to determinethat a new document record header has been encountered.  It may be assimple as the three-character string "MSH" or as complex as "HEADERBEGIN".The signal "@@@", used by the Surgery Package option to transmit operativenotes, is another possibility. NOTE: Although you may define this parameter independently for eachDIVISION, we recommend that you choose just one such signal per site.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>end of message signal</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Applies only to transfers made using the ASCII protocol.  This is the freetext signal to the upload process that the entire file/stream has beentransmitted without difficulty, and no more lines of data need to be read.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>begin report text signal</td><td>0;12</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the signal to the upload processor that the fixed-field header fora given report record has been fully read, and that the body of thenarrative report follows.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>major delimiter</td><td>0;13</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This ASCII character separates the various pieces of fixed-fieldinformation in the message header. Please avoid using delimiters such as",", or ":", which may be contained within the data itself, using insteadless common symbols such as "|", "\" or "~".</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>future appointment range</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This parameter determines how far in advance a future appointment maybe selected when entering a document for outpatient care. Allowable values range from 1 to 180 days, defaulting to 1 day.</td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>pace character</td><td>0;15</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Applies only to transfers which use the ASCII protocol. This is the ASCII value of the character which VISTA sends to the remotecomputer to acknowledge receipt of the previous text line and to promptthe remote to transmit another line. You may choose any character with anASCII value between 1 and 126. If you are using the same remote to upload both MailMan messages andtextual reports, then we recommend using the ">" symbol, ASCII 62.Otherwise, we suggest using the ACK character (ASCII 6). NOTE: you may need to specify the same character as part of the ASCIIPROTOCOL parameters of the terminal emulation software on the remote.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>upload header format</td><td>0;16</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>C:captioned<br/>D:delimited string<br/></td><td></td><td>This field determines whether the upload filer expects delimited string orcaptioned formats for the header of each document.</td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>upload protocol</td><td>0;17</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>a:ASCII<br/>k:KERMIT<br/></td><td></td><td>This is the upload protocol used to transmit documents,with a for ASCII, or k for KERMIT.</td></tr><tr><td>.18</td><td>run upload filer in foreground</td><td>0;18</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter specifies whether to run the filer for the upload processin the foreground or in the background (as a Task). If no preference is specified, the filer runs in the BACKGROUND.</td></tr><tr><td>.22</td><td>enable chart copy prompt</td><td>0;22</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>OUT OF SERVICE.  See TIU Document Parameter ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS.</td></tr><tr><td>1.05</td><td>amendment signature block</td><td>1;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>OUT OF SERVICE.  The signer's normal signature block is used foramendments. This parameter allows the site to specify the format of the signatureblock for an amendment.  While Business Rules determine who may amend documents, generally it isthe user class CHIEF,MIS who may do so. If this user is not the site'sPrivacy Act officer, then it may be desirable to enter a statementindicating that the user is signing on behalf of the Privacy Act Officer. For example, if the user's name is John Smith, while the site's PrivacyAct Officer is Jane Doe, RRT, then the AMENDMENT SIGNATURE BLOCK might beentered as: "for Jane Doe, RRT, PRIVACY ACT OFFICER". The amendment information on the document would then appear as:             AMENDED 10/26/92            /es/ JOHN SMITH            for Jane Doe, RRT, PRIVACY ACT OFFICER</td></tr><tr><td>1.06</td><td>blank character string</td><td>1;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This string of characters is used by the transcriptionist to represent a"blank" when a word or phrase in the dictation cannot be understood forinclusion in the transcription.</td></tr><tr><td>1.07</td><td>enable notifications date</td><td>1;7</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This date indicates to TIU when to begin sending signature notifications(available/overdue for signature) to expected signers/cosigners.Notifications are sent beginning on this date, and only for documentsentered on/after this date.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>upload error alert recipient</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8925_992.html">8925.992</a></td><td></td><td>These persons receive alerts from the upload/filer process when a documentcannot be filed/located or has missing fields. This field is OVERRIDDEN by recipients set for the given document type inparameter FILING ERROR ALERT RECIPIENTS in the TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETERSfile.</td></tr><tr><td>3.1</td><td>start of add sgnr alert period</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the start date for evaluating documents that have overdueadditional signatures. The value must be in a FileMan date range formatsuch as 6D, 3W or 4M. If this field is left blank, all documentsevaluated that have a date less than the END OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIODdate will be included. Since the addition of the LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD parameter thisfield should be set to the same value as that field. If LENGTH OFSIGNER ALERT PERIOD is left blank then set this field to 12M, thedefault value of the LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD when no value isentered.  LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD determines how far back in timedocuments are evaluated.</td></tr><tr><td>3.2</td><td>end of add sgnr alert period</td><td>3;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the length in time from the current date that the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will stop regenerating alerts for overdue additional signatures.The value must be in a FileMan date range format such as 6D, 3W or 4M.  If no value is entered, the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will search for documentsin the TIU DOCUMENT File (8925) up to the current date.</td></tr><tr><td>3.3</td><td>length of signer alert period</td><td>3;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the length of time that the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will go back prior to "today" when searching for documents that have overdue signatures. The value must be in a FileMan date range format such as 6D, 3W or 4M.  If no value is entered, the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will begin searching for documents starting at 1 year prior to "today" in the TIU DOCUMENTS file (8925).</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
