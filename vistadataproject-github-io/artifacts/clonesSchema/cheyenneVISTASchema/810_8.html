Each counting group defines reminder terms and type of counts to be totaled during an extract run. Counting groups are referenced and combined into one Extract Counting Rule inthe REMINDER EXTRACT COUNTING RULE file (#810.7).   The sequence number determines the order in which finding totals are saved toand displayed from the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY (#810.3) file.   Nationally distributed counting groups are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot bemodified bysites.   Sites should name locally created counting groups according to their local naming convention.  </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This file contains groups of findings that will be used to accumulate findingtotals during the reminder extract process.  </td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>count type</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>MRF:MOST RECENT FINDING COUNT<br/>MRFP:MOST RECENT FINDING PATIENT COUNT<br/>UR:UTILIZATION IN REPORTING PERIOD FINDING COUNT<br/></td><td></td><td>Count is used to specify the different ways the extract can countfindings:MRF (Most Recent Finding count) counts the most recent occurrence ofeach  term in the group.
