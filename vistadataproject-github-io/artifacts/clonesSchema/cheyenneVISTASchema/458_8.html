Nurses on the 9-monthAWS shall be required to schedule 75 percent of the fiscal year as workand 25% of the fiscal year as recess, prior to beginning the AWS.  Theperiods of work and recess are prorated from the first pay period in whichthe AWS begins and the last pay period of the fiscal year.  An ETA fiscal year runs from the first full pay period after September 30 through the following year and the entire pay period that contains September 30.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>nurse(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="450.html">450</a></td><td>B</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>fiscal year(+)</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>C</td><td>This is the fiscal year during which the 9-month AWS is effective.The fiscal year for 2006 (FY06, sometimes written FY05-06) is fromOctober 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006.  However, the fiscal yearfor purposes of the 9-month AWS will be governed also by complete pay periods, since the nurses normal hours=80 and duty basis = part-time, must be in effect for the entire pay period. Thus some 9-month AWSfiscal years may have 50, 52 or 54 weeks.  The fiscal year is definedas the 12 months from the first full pay period after October 1 through the full pay period that contains September 30.  In theexample, September 30, 2007 is the first day of pay period 20 andthus the entire pay period is included in the weeks for the 9-monthAWS schedule for FY07.  The last pay period--weeks 53 and 54--arealso part of the fiscal year for the AWS since September 30 is inthat pay period.          Week   PayPd Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat        =============Oct 2006============  1     06-20   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  2             8   9  10  11  12  13  14  3     06-21  15  16  17  18  19  20  21        ... 51     07-19  16  17  18  19  20  21  22 52            23  24  25  26  27  28  29 53     07-20  30   1   2   3   4   5   6        =============Oct 2007============ 54             7   8   9  10  11  12  13</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>aws start date</td><td>3;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>recess weeks</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="458_82.html">458.82</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple contains each recess week and the hours associated with that week.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>enter/edit date/time</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="458_83.html">458.83</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
