For example, a user is authorizedto perform the Signature event, but a user subscribes to ("signs up toreceive") a Notification event.This field helps to define the meaning of an event and its relationship toa user.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>applies to</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>DOC:document<br/>DEF:definition<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>associated protocol</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="101.html">101</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>user verb</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This word or phrase is displayed in explanatory messages when the user isdenied authority to perform the given action.  Such a message might read,"You cannot SIGN this unsigned progress note", where the USER VERB is"SIGN". The USER VERB must make grammatical sense inserted in a sentence of theform: "You cannot [     ] this unsigned progress note." Please use uppercase, 3-50 characters.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>document verb</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This word or phrase is used in business rule options when displayingan authorization in sentence form.     A business rule might read: "An unsigned Progress Note can BE SIGNED byan author/dictator." The DOCUMENT VERB in this rule is "BE SIGNED". The DOCUMENT VERB must make grammatical sense inserted in a sentence ofthe form: "An unsigned progress note can [      ] by an author/dictator." Please use uppercase, 3-40 characters.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>user verb modifier</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sometimes, in writing messages to the user denying a permission, theaction must be split into two parts.  In such cases, the USER VERBMODIFIER is the second part. Example: In "You cannot LINK this UNSIGNED PROGRESS NOTE with a request",the USER VERB is "LINK", and the USER VERB MODIFIER is "with a request". The USER VERB MODIFIER must make grammatical sense when inserted in:      "You cannot LINK this UNSIGNED PROGRESS NOTE [    ]." Please use lowercase, 3-30 characters. If an action has an IDENTIFYING PHRASE or a USER VERB MODIFIER, thebusiness rule ADD or EDIT action presents the user with a clarifying noteabout the rule they are creating immediately after the user enters anaction.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>identifying phrase</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is NOT required.  It is available for use in helping usersidentify the correct action when writing business rules.  It appearswhen selecting actions from a list. For examples, see actions ATTACH TO ID NOTE, and ATTACH ID ENTRY. If an action has an IDENTIFYING PHRASE or a USER VERB MODIFIER, thebusiness rule ADD or EDIT action presents the user with a clarifying noteabout the rule they are creating immediately after the user enters anaction.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>implied event</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8930_81.html">8930.81</a></td><td></td><td>Some events imply other events.  For example, the ability to Sign adocument implies the ability to View the document.  Thus, View is animplied event for the Signature event. Authorization/Subscription file, the user will be shown implied events forthe given event and asked if they wish to include implied events for thecurrent entry.  If so, a copy of the current entry will be created for eachimplied event.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>description</td><td>2;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td> The event description will be used in conjunction with theAuthorization/Subscription field to define what it means to associateusers with the event.In most cases, this event description will suffice to determine themeaning of User Authorization/Subscription file entries. In rare cases, further description of what an event means when associatedwith users, document type and document status will be made in thedescription field of the User Authorization/Subscription file.  Forexample, a signature event associated with documents of statuscompleted means a walkup signature. This information will be used by persons creating entries in the UserAuthorization/Subscription file and by persons assigning users to userclasses, when checking what events those user classes are associated with.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><h2>Referenced by 1 types</h2><ol><li><a href="8930_1.html">USR AUTHORIZATION/SUBSCRIPTION</a> (8930.1) -- action</li></ol></div>
