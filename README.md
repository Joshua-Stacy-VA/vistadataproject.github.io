__A fresh look from a new perspective:__ A vista of a sunrise at the higest peak of Maui (the research and development headquarters of the VISTA Data Project) signifies"high altitude", "fresh look", "new light", "new dawn", "rebirth", and "future looking". Add to this vista the distant moon...and we have not just a new dawn for VISTA, but also a moonshot.
