__VISTA Data: A fresh look from a high perspective:__  Vista of a sunrise at the higest peak of Maui... the R&D headquarters of the VISTA Data Project... signifying a "high altitude", "fresh look", "new light", "new dawn", "rebirth", "future looking". Add to this mountain  vista the distant moon...and we have not just fresh new dawn for VISTA, but potentially a moonshot.
