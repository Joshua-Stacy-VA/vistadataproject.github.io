Each device isidentified with a unique name.  Each is associated with a $I valuewhich may correspond with a hardware port or, on layered systems,a host file or directory.  If there are several devices for the samevolume set and $I, one may be given sign-on system status.  Devicesmay also be assigned to hunt groups to share work.  This file iscross-referenced by name, $I, volume set(CPU), and sign-on/systemdevice.  It is also cross-referenced by hunt group, local synonym,mnemonic, subtype, and form currently mounted.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>XU;ZIS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the device. It is used at the 'DEVICE' promptto select this device. It should not be the internal name forthe device but a logical one.It must start with 1 uppercase and not contain lowercase.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>location of terminal(+)</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a free text description of where the device is located,e.g. Ward 2A nurse station, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>mnemonic</td><td>MN;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="3_501.html">3.501</a></td><td></td><td>These are alternate names which may be used to select the device.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>local synonym</td><td>1;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>LSYN</td><td>This is an alternate name which may be used to select the device.When using the LOCAL SYNONYM to select the device, selection can onlyoccur on the local CPU.  For example, if you assigned a LOCAL SYNONYMto one device on the local CPU, and the same name to a device onthe remote CPU, selection using the LOCAL SYNONYM will returnthe device on the local CPU.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>purge old print queue files</td><td>0;13</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field determines whether old HFS files associated with entries in thePRINT QUEUE JOB (#3.52) file should be deleted. It only applies to devicesof the PRINT QUEUE type. For print queues, an intermediate host file iscreated in the PRINT_QUEUES subdirectory. Normally, these files are automatically deleted once they have been submittedto the print queue.  For those files that are not automatically deleted,there is a scheduled option that will periodically delete host files thathave been somehow left in existence past their usefulness.Setting this field to NO will prevent the purge option from deleting HFS filescreated via this device.  Setting this field to NO should only be done ona temporary basis while troubleshooting a problem involving a print queue. The default value for this field is YES.  </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$i(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>C</td><td>This field holds the Hardware port name that the OS can identify whenreferencing a port on a CPU.On layered systems where opening of host files is supported,this field may hold the host file name.When defining a spool device entry(TYPE="SPL") on VAX DSM or MSM-Unix,enter the name of directory where spool host files will be created.</td></tr><tr><td>1.9</td><td>volume set(cpu)</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field holds the name of the CPU to which this device belongs.This field holds the name of the CPU where the physical port resides.On DSM-11, VAX DSM, this field may hold the name of the Volume Set.On M/11+, this field may hold the name of the Directory Set. If no name has been entered for this field, this device is assumedto be accessible from all CPUs in the network.  In other words,when this device is referenced, the device handler will operateas if this device is resident on the local CPU.   For example, if there is a device that uses the same $I on each CPU,one entry can be made in the Device File by leaving the 'VolumeSet(CPU)' Field null.  This shortcut will work only if the same $Ihas been associated with this device on every CPU.</td></tr><tr><td>1.95</td><td>sign-on/system device</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>If answered 'YES', this field identifies that this entry is the primarydevice among those device entries that have the same $I with the sameVOLUME SET(CPU). Among those device entries that have a common $I and CPU,only one of these entries can have this field set to 'YES'.If none of the common device entries are set to 'YES', thedefault device will be identified by the first device onthe CPU x-ref.  The default device is used when the devicehandler is invoked with $I as the device to be selected.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>type(+)</td><td>TYPE;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>TRM:TERMINAL<br/>OTH:OTHER<br/>MT:MAGTAPE<br/>SDP:SDP<br/>SPL:SPOOL<br/>BAR:BARCODE READER<br/>HFS:HOST FILE SERVER<br/>VTRM:VIRTUAL TERMINAL<br/>RES:RESOURCES<br/>CHAN:NETWORK CHANNEL<br/>IMPC:IMAGING WORK STATION<br/>PQ:PRINT QUEUE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field has the general type of device on the CPU.  'TRM' is the mostcommon entry.      TRM -- Terminal devices such as most crts and printers             should be associated with a corresponding device entry             with a type of 'TRM'.      HFS -- Host File Server is only available on mumps platforms             that exists on a layered system(e.g.: VMS, UNIX, NT, etc.).             This type and the associated functionality provides             the vehicle to read and write to host level files.             Instead of directing reports to a printer, the results             could be placed into a VMS, NT or UNIX file.  This would             allow a non-mumps based statistical package or spreadsheet             to use data produced by the mumps based application by             simply extracting data from the host file.     VTRM -- Virtual Terminal Server devices are those that are associated             with a dynamically created mumps port identification($I).             A generic device entry with a device type of 'VTRM'             can be established for users who log into the system             through terminal servers.      RES -- Resources is a type used for special sequencing of tasks             that do not require a particular device.     CHAN -- Network Channels are high speed devices that use network             protocols such as TCP/IP.      OTH -- Other devices that do not fit a particular category             should be given a type of 'OTH'.       MT -- Magtape device should have a type of 'MT'.      SPL -- Spool device is a predefined allocated disk space similar             to SDP.  However, access to the spool device can be achieved             from multiple users simultaneously.      BAR -- Bar code reader.  This type identifies the device             as a barcode reader.      SDP -- Sequential Disk Processor is a predefined allocated             disk space used for sequential processing.  On DSM-11             and M/11+ systems, devices 59 thru 62 are reserved for SDP.             On MSM, the Sequential Block Processor(SBP) is essentially             the same as SDP. This has been replaced with HFS.     IMPC -- Imaging work station device(reserved for future use for             DHCP Imaging Project).     PQ   -- Print Queues.  This type of device will be used on             Cache/VMS,Linux, or Unix systems to create host files and             pass them to a print server.  Print Queue devices are             not used on Windows systems.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>subtype(+)</td><td>SUBTYPE;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_2.html">3.2</a></td><td></td><td>This field tells what type of terminal is on a terminal port.It has a great impact on whether the proper terminal control codesget sent to the terminal.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>ask device</td><td>0;3</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field controls if the 'DEVICE' question is asked when a callis made to ^%ZIS.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>ask parameters</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>On devices of TYPE 'TRM' and 'VTRM', this field controlsif the 'RIGHT MARGIN' question is asked after selecting the device.On devices of TYPE 'MT', 'SDP', 'BAR', and 'OTH', this field controlsif the 'ADDRESS/PARAMETERS' question is asked after selecting the device.</td></tr><tr><td>5.1</td><td>ask host file</td><td>1;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer 'yes' if 'HOST FILE NAME:' should be asked when the deviceis selected.
