Taxonomies areused as Clinical Reminders findings and provide a way to define aset of codes as a single finding. Taxonomies are structured so thatany of the coding systems defined in Lexicon's Coding System (file#757.03) can be used. However, in order for a coding system to beused in Clinical Reminders, there must be a source in VistA wherethe coded patient data is stored. Examples are V POV (file#9000010.07) which stores ICD diagnosis codes and PTF (file #45)which stores ICD diagnosis and procedure codes. The coding systemsthat meet this criteria are listed for selection in the taxonomyeditor.This file contains a combination of nationally distributed and localentries. Nationally distributed entries have their names prefixed withVA- and their Class is National. Local entry names cannot start withVA- or have a National Class.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the taxonomy.

This flag is set to ACTIVE inthe distribution. As part of the installation, each site should reviewthe taxonomy definitions and inactivate those that do not meet thesite's needs.

'CU' would include chronicproblems and those whose priority is undefined.
