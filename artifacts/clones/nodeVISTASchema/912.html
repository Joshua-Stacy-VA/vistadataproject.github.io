Example:  On 6/12/93@1000 an employee discoversa chain saw missing from the Engineering Shop (Ending Date/Time ofOffense).

Only in cases involving a range oftime will this field be used.  In these instances, DATE/TIME OFOFFENSE will be used to record the earliest time the occurencecould have taken place, and ENDING DATE/TIME OF OFFENSE will beused to record when you were notified of the occurence.Example:  6/12/93@1000 an employee discovers a chain saw missingfrom the Engineering Shop (ENDING DATE/TIME OF OFFENSE).
