There should be only ONE siteentry in this file.  Before running the package, at least one Division must be added to the file and at least one Clinic entered for the Division.  The INTERFACE TO PCE and SEND TO PCE parameters control whether visit data is sent to PCE. If the INTERFACE TO PCE is set to YESthen the overnight job to send data to PCE will be active. It willsend visit data for any Division that has the SEND TO PCE fieldset to YES.  Each Division has a USE ASP CLINIC FILE NUMBER field which allows you to associate existing clinic file numbers with patients. You can alsoactivate the AMIE C&P Interface for specific Divisions and specifythat when entering data for a Division the user is not required to enter Audiometric data for Hearing Loss cases by setting the BYPASS AUDIOMETRICS parameter to YES.    Data in this file SHOULD NOT be altered through the use of VA FileMan; input should take place ONLY through the QUASAR menu options.  Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition SHOULD NOT be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>site name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td>B</td><td>The SITE NAME field is a pointer to the INSTITUTION file (#4).
