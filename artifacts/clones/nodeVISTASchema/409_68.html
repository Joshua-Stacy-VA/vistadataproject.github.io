The types of encounters that caused entries to be added to this file are appointments, add/edit stop codes and dispositions.  If the encounter needs to be checked out then it will have a status of 'PENDING ACTION'. The site will not receive workload credit if the status remains 'PENDING ACTION'.  'PENDING ACTION' includes both  'ACTION REQUIRED' and 'NO ACTION TAKEN' statuses.  If the encounter has been no-showed or cancelled then it will NOT be in this file.  Inpatient encounters will always have a status of 'INPATIENT APPOINTMENT'.  Appointments made for non-count clinics will always have a status of 'NON-COUNT'.  All other encounters will have a status of 'CHECKED OUT'. </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>date(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the date and time when outpatient encounter occurred.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>patient(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>C</td><td>This field contains the patient associated with the encounter.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>clinic stop code(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="40_7.html">40.7</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains the CLINIC STOP CODE associated with the outpatientencounter.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>location</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44.html">44</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains the location, usually a clinic, where the encounter tookplace.This field is optional.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>visit file entry</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9000010.html">9000010</a></td><td>AVSIT</td><td>This field indicates the VISIT file entry associated with this encounter.This field is  optional and will only be filled in if the site is runningthe Visit Tracking module.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>parent encounter</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="409_68.html">409.68</a></td><td>APAR</td><td>This field associates the current encounter with a parent encounter.For example, if there are add/edit stop codes associated with anappointment, then all the add/edit encounter entries will havethis parent field filled in with the appointment encounter.This relationship allows the check out software to use the check outinformation of the appointment for the add/edits, as well.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>check out process completion</td><td>0;7</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the check out process has been successfullycompleted for this outpatient encounter.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>originating process type(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:APPOINTMENT<br/>2:STOP CODE ADDITION<br/>3:DISPOSITION<br/>4:CREDIT STOP CODE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the type of process that created this encounter.The types are the follwoing:       1 - appointment       2 - add/edit stop code       3 - disposition</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>extended reference</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the internal multiple entry of the originatingprocess that created the encounter. The reference mapping is the following:         Originating Process    Global Reference        -------------------    ----------------        1 - appointments       ^SC(<LOCATION>,"S",<DATE/TIME>,1,<EXTERNAL REF>)            Note: If this field is equal to 999999, it means that the                  appointment encounter was created by the ACRP Database                  Conversion functionality in patch SD*5.3*211.
