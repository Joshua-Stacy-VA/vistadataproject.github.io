Number of Procedures: When a selected procedure code CONTAINS inherenttime elements (such as "30M Massage Therapy") then a volume of one isusually entered, meaning 1 of this specific procedure/service wasprovided.          OR   2. Time: Amount of time shown in increments of minutes (M). When a selected procedure code DOES NOT have inherent time elements THEN thevolume field is used to capture the time spent completing the procedure/service: 1 = 15M, 2 = 30M, 3= 45M, etc.       OR 3. Days: Number of days patient was in VA paid facilities such as State Home, DOM, or a Nursing Home. When entering workload for a patient in aVA-Paid facility, volume of 1 means 1 day, 2 means 2 days, etc. NOTE: It is imperative to understand and keep track of the values you are entering in the volume field and whatthey represent for the patients you are treating.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>*provider(+)</td><td>0;11</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the provider performing this procedure.Provider can be selected from entries in the NEW PERSONfile (#200). Starred for inactivation with EC*2.0*72.
