DO NOT edit data in this file withVA File Manager. Entries in this file are created by other applications calling approvedapplication specific routines.  This file is the link between AccountsReceivable and an application.  Integrated billing will attempt toaggregate charges where possible to reduce the number of account entries necessary.  Resolution of charges from Accounts Receivable wouldthen be accomplished through Integrated Billing. Entries in this file will not be deleted or edited (except for thestatus field, cancellation reasons filed, last updated field, anduser last updating field).  Rather than deleting an entry, an entryis "reversed" by creating an additional entry with the IB ACTION TYPEentry that cancels the original entry.  An entry is edited by creatingthe cancellation entry and then adding an updated new entry.  All entriesrelated to the original entry will be related by the PARENT LINK field. There is also an IB ACTION type that is an event, which may includeHospital admissions, NHCU admissions, and outpatient visits.  All ofthe charges associated with an event will be related to that event bythe EVENT LINK field.  Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>reference number(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the station number concatenated with the internal number of this entry in this file.  The purpose of this number is to providea unique number for each entry for each station.  Modifying thisnumber may have serious consequences when and where centralizedbilling and accounting are taking place.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>patient</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>C</td><td>This is the patient that received services, care, or medications thatcaused this entry to be created.  If the debtor is the patient, thispatient is the debtor.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>action type</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="350_1.html">350.1</a></td><td>AE</td><td>This field points to an entry in the IB ACTION TYPE file.  Entries inthe IB ACTION TYPE file provide specific information about the typeof entry that is being created and provides data necessary to AR andto resolve the data from the application. Applications passing data to IB determine the Action Type and pass thisto IB.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>resulting from</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This will be the soft-link back to the entry in any file that causedthis transaction to be set.  It will be in the format of:     filenumber:entry;[node:sub-entry];[node:sub-entry]... The number of node:sub-entry pieces will depend on the level ofmultiples that cause the entry.  For example, a new prescriptionmight be '52:345678'  but the first refill might be '52:345678;1,1'.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>status</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="350_21.html">350.21</a></td><td>AC</td><td>This is the current status of this entry.  The IB routines will maintainthis field.  An entry will be incomplete when it is created, completewhen all data needed to pass to AR is there, and Billed after passing toAR and the bill number and/or transaction number have been added. If the entry represents a billable inpatient/NHCU admission (event), thestatus will be Incomplete while the patient is admitted, and thenComplete when the patient has been discharged.  All entries createdduring the Means Test conversion will have the status Converted Record. With Integrated Billing version 2.0, this field is changed from a setof codes field to a pointer which points to the IB ACTION STATUS(#350.21) file.  This change will allow new action statuses to beadded more easily, and permit various characteristics to be assignedto the statuses to facilitate system processing.  IT IS IMPERATIVETHAT THESE NEW POINTED-TO ENTRIES HAVE AN INTERNAL ENTRY NUMBER INFILE #350.21 WHICH IS EQUAL TO THEIR PREVIOUS CODE VALUE.  PLEASECAREFULLY READ THE IB ACTION STATUS FILE DESCRIPTION FOR MOREINFORMATION.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>units</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of units that will be multiplied times a specificcharge that will be calculated to create the total charge.  This ispassed to IB from the application.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>total charge</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the total charge for this entry, that will be passed toAR.  It is calculated and stored by IB routines.  NOTE: Several IBACTION entries may be combined into one pass to AR so that there maynot be a one to one relationship between this entry and one in AR. The TOTAL CHARGE for all entries will always be positive.  It isnecessary to refer to the IB ACTION TYPE file to determine if thisis a NEW, CANCEL or UPDATE.  Cancel action types will cause a decreaseadjustment to a bill for this amount.  New and Update action typeswill cause an increase adjustment to a bill for this amount.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>brief description</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a brief description of the application entry that caused thisIB ACTION entry to be created.  For example, for Pharmacy co-paymentsit might indicate '100999-ENDURAL-2' which would indicate that this wasprescription number 100999, the drug name started with ENDURAL and2 units (30-60 days supply) were given. The logic to calculate this will be supplied by the application andstored with the IB ACTION TYPE entry for this action.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>parent charge</td><td>0;9</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="350.html">350</a></td><td>AD</td><td>This is a pointer to the original IB ACTION entry that this entry refersto.  For a NEW entry, it will point to itself.  For all other entries itwill point to the original entry. An application then only needs to maintain the pointer to the originalentry and can find the most recent entry for this entry as   S x=$O(^IB("APDT",parent,0),x=$O(^(x,0)) If x '= parent then this is an updated entry, the pointer to theIB ACTION TYPE file will give you the sequence number which will indicateif this is cancelled or an updated entry.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>cancellation reason</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="350_3.html">350.3</a></td><td></td><td>This is the reason that this charge was cancelled.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>ar bill number</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>ABIL</td><td>This is the free text bill number that this entry is charged to.  Itis in the format of a PAT number.

An entry thatcauses a new bill number to be created will not have an AR TRANSACTIONfile entry associated with it as the charge data will be stored withthe original bill.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>institution</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>This is the facility that caused this bill.

For anevent entry, this field will point to itself.  For all IB ACTION charges (new, cancelled, and updated) associated with a billable event,this field will point to that event. Note that cancelled and updated actions will still point to the parent(new) action through the Parent Charge (.09) field, in the same manneras Pharmacy co-pay charges.</td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>event date</td><td>0;17</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field will only be used for those IB ACTION entries which representHospital/NHCU admissions and outpatient visits for which Category Ccopayment and per diem charges will be billed to the patient.

The inverse(negative) value of this date will be cross-referenced by patient forlook-up purposes.</td></tr><tr><td>.18</td><td>date last billed</td><td>0;18</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field will only be used for those IB ACTION entries which representinpatient or NHCU admissions for which Category C copayment and per diemcharges will be billed to the patient.
