Most of the fields have MUMPs cross-references with which theyare associated that are used by the software for quick access to thespecific data. Some of the fields defined may not be in use presently, butare reserved for future development.  Review the Imaging InstallationManual for instructions on making entries into this file. Non-integrated sites and Integrated sites that have one shared image storage location have one record.  Integrated sites where each site hastheir own image storage have one record for each of the associated sites.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>MAG</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>institution name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td>B</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>current namespace(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The Image file is 14 characters.
