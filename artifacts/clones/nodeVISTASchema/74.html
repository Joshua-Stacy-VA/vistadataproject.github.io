These reports areusually first dictated by the interpreting physician before being enteredby the transcriptionist. The Radiology/Nuclear Medicine software includes an HL7 interface tosupport report entry using voice recognition systems. The data in this file has three basic sections:          I. Demographic information about the file                - patient, date reported, date entered etc.        II. Text Data                - clinical history, report and impression       III. Computed Fields that obtain data from patient's exam record                - technician, procedure etc. The computed fields can be a very efficent way to do File Man prints andsearches of exam record data, as opposed to doing prints and searchesthrough the 'RAD/NUC MED PATIENT' file.  Data Storage ------------The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED REPORTS file is stored in the ^RARPT(global. This global is very volatile and should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function. Because of the large amount of disk space the report text will demand ofthe system, the module has a 'Purge Data' function that willallow the site manager to delete the 'REPORT TEXT' and 'CLINCIAL HISTORY'fields on a periodic basis. It is up to the computer site manager andthe imaging coordinator to determine how long this data will remainon-line. The 'IMPRESSION' text will not be purged. In the future, the module will also have an archive function.  Input Templates ---------------The following is a list of input templates used by the packageand the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:                    Compiled Name              Routine    Description; Option(s) ----              --------   ---------------------- RA REPORT EDIT    ^RACTWR*   Used to enter/edit reports and associated                              information into this file;                              RA RPTENTRY  RA VERIFY         ^RACTVR*   Used to indicate a report has been verified; REPORT ONLY                  RA BATCHVERIFY, RA RPTVERIFY  RA PRE-VERIFY REPORT EDIT    Used to edit reports and associated                               information in this file.

Validchoices are: 'V' for Verified, 'R' for Released/Not Verified, 'PD' forProblem Draft, 'D' for Draft, 'EF' for Electronically Filed and 'X' forDeleted. 'V' (Verified) status refers to a report that is verified by the interpreting physician and is available for display outside the Rad/Nuc Med Department to appropriate users, such as ward clerks, nurses, and physicians. 'R' (Released/Not Verified) status refers to a report that is not verified by the interpreting physician and is available for display outside the Rad/Nuc Med Department.  The 'R' status is allowed only when the parameter that controls this feature, 'Allow Released/Unverified' of the 'RAD/NUC MED DIVISION' file (#79), is set to 'Yes'.  Use the 'Display Report' option to view reports with the 'R' status. 'D' (Draft) status or 'PD' (Problem Draft) status refers to a report that is available only for display in the Rad/Nuc Med Department.  A statement describing the problem to the interpreting physician is printed at the end of reports with the 'PD' status. 'EF' (Electronically Filed) status refers to a report that is interpreted outside the Rad/Nuc Med Department.  The content is not the actual interpreted report, but canned text referring to the outside interpreted report. 'X' (Deleted) status refers to a report that is deleted from a case, but remains in the database though not selectable from any Radiology options.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>date report entered</td><td>0;6</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the date and time that the report was entered into thesystem by the transcriptionist.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>verified date</td><td>0;7</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>As of July, 1985, this field contains the date and the time that it wasindicated to the system that the report was verified by the interpretingphysician. An option allowing online verification lets the interpreting physicianverify the report directly via a CRT.
