If the resolution logic evaluates totrue, then the last resolution date is determined. The applicablefrequency is added to the resolution date to determine when thereminder is next due. If the resolution logic evaluates to false,then reminder is due.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>use in patient cohort logic</td><td>0;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>&:AND<br/>!:OR<br/>&':AND NOT<br/>!':OR NOT<br/></td><td></td><td>This optional field is used to indicate that this finding itemshould be included as part of the Patient Cohort Logic for thisreminder. Note - if the CUSTOMIZED COHORT LOGIC is defined, then thisfield is ignored. Valid entries for the USE IN PATIENT COHORT LOGIC field are:                      EQUATES TO BOOLEAN  OPERATOR  VALUE     OPERATOR LOGIC  --------  -----     ------------------            BLANK     not included in Patient Cohort Logic                      (Use @ to delete value)   &        AND       &(Finding)   !

OR NOT    !'(Finding) All finding items that have a value in this field are automaticallycombined to create the DEFAULT COHORT LOGIC. The default logicstring initially includes (SEX)&(AGE), regardless of whether thebaseline specifies SEX and AGE criteria. Each finding item with avalue in the Use In Patient Cohort Logic field is appended to thestring by using the operator and finding item. For example, iffinding item 2 had an operator for this field of "&" then the stringwould be (SEX)&(AGE)&FI(2).After all findings have been evaluated, the finding item is replacedby its true or false value in the cohort logic and the cohort logicis evaluated. If the cohort logic evaluates to true, then the reminderis applicable to the patient. If the cohort logic evaluates to falsethen reminder is non-applicable or N/A.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>minimum age</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field specifies the minimum age for defining an age rangeassociated with a frequency.

Allowed units are H (hours) D (days), W (weeks), M(months), and Y (years). If a reminder is only to be given once in alifetime use a frequency of 99Y. The special frequency of 0Y willmake a reminder never due.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>rank frequency</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used to rank the frequency and age range sets associatedwith a finding. If there is more than one true finding that canoverride the baseline frequency age range set, then the determination ofwhich one to use is made based on the finding with the highest rank.Ranks can range from 1 to 999 with 1 being the highest rank. When the Rank field is blank (null) for all true findings that canoverride the baseline frequency age range set, then the frequency thatwill cause the reminder to be given most often will be used. Forexample, if finding 1 has a frequency of 6 months, and finding 2 has afrequency of 1 year, finding 1 will be used to override the baseline.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>name</td><td>40;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the NAME field is present it will be displayed with the functionfinding result in the Clinical Maintenance output.
