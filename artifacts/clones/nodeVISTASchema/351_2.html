If the care was determined to be related toexposure, the patient should not be billed, but the case disposition must be documented. A case record will automatically be filed at admission for this specialgroup of patients, and updated when the patient is discharged.  Thesite then has 45 days to disposition the case, i.e. determine if thecare was related to the claimed exposure.  If the care was unrelated,and copayment and per diem charges are created in the Cancel/Edit/AddPatient Charges option, the case record will be automaticallydispositioned.  If the patient is not going to be billed, the reasonfor not billing must be entered into this file. Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>patient(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>B</td><td>This is the patient whose inpatient episode must be tracked.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>admission</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="405.html">405</a></td><td>AC</td><td>This field points to the admission in the PATIENT MOVEMENT (#405)file which is being tracked.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>patient type</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:AGENT ORANGE<br/>2:IONIZING RADIATION<br/>3:SOUTHWEST ASIA<br/>4:SERVICE CONNECTED<br/>5:MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA<br/>6:HEAD/NECK CANCER<br/>7:COMBAT VETERAN<br/>8:PROJECT 112/SHAD<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to determine whether the patient has claimed exposureto Agent Orange, Ionizing Radiation, Southwest Asia, MilitarySexual Trauma, Head/Neck Cancer or Project 112/SHAD.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>billing event</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="350.html">350</a></td><td>AD</td><td>This field points to the event record in the INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION(#350) file which may be used to reference all charges associated withthe admission.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>patient status</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:ADMITTED<br/>2:DISCHARGED<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates whether the patient is admitted or has beendischarged.
