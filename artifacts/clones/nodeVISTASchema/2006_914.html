They come in two varieties: user-definable, and business. User-definable retention policies can be created and mapped to artifact descriptors, to serve as intrinsic retention policies. They can be inactivated, or "logically deleted", but only if no artifact descriptors are pointing to them. They can never be physically deleted, since there are artifacts that still point to the old retention policies, and we need to keep the historical record of retention policies that have been applied to this artifact over time. Business retention policies are designed to be called by business code for certain patients (e.g., Agent Orange retention policy, Employee retention policy, etc.). These retention policies will be installed with the patch and can be "replaced" with updated versions, but not deleted, since business logic will presumably expect to find them.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>display name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>A text description of the policy for display by configuration user interface.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>archive duration years(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The number of years from the duration trigger date that an artifact must be available.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>archive duration trigger(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>CD:Create Date<br/>LAD:Last Accessed Date<br/>DD:Deceased Date<br/></td><td></td><td>The trigger event for initiating the countdown for archive duration.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>minimum archive copies(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Number of archive copies required by this retention policy.  </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>minimum offsite copies(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Number of offsite copies required by this retention policy.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>business key</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Holds a key that can be used by clients to look up retention policies for specific business scenarios, e.g. Agent Orange cases, employees, etc. Business Key is not unique across all records, but must be unique among active records.
