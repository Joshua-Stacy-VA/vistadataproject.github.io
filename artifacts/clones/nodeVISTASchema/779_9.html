Although it is structurally and functionally an independent system, it is officially part of HL7 1.6.  This isa messaging system similar to the old HL7 1.6 package, but it was designed fromthe ground up and is more robust, more capable, and supports a much highermessage throughput.  This file contains the priorities of HLO queues as assigned by the systemoperations staff. It is not necessary to assign a priority to a queue.  However, doing sowill change the frequency that HLO services the queue.  Important queues thattend to be backed up should be assigned a higher priority.  Less importantqueues may be assigned a lower priority.  The goal of setting queue prioritiesis to balance the HLO resources over the queues in order to obtain a desiredperformance.Currently priorities may be set only for outgoing queues, though the filewas designed to also support the assignment of priorities for incomming queues.The option for entering the type of queue (incomming or outgoing) currentlywill automatically default to outgoing. A future enhancment may supportthe ability to assign priorities to incomming queues.To set the priority the name of the queue must be specified.  As explained, currently the queue will be assumed to be outgoing. Optionally,if the priorityis to be set only for a specific link then the link must be specified.Examples:You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named "HLO OUT" withoutspecifying the link.  The effect would be to set the priority of all outgoingqueues named "HLO OUT" regardless of the link.You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named "HLO OUT" and also specifythe link.  The effect would be to set the priority of the outgoingqueue named "HLO OUT" that is sending messages via that specific link only.If a queue's priority is specified to apply to all links, but that queue'spriority is also specified for a specific link, that specific priority settingwill override the general one.  </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>queue(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The name of either an outgoing or incoming queue.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>direction(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>IN:INCOMING<br/>OUT:OUTGOING<br/></td><td></td><td>HLO includes queues that contain incoming messages and other queues thatcontain outgoing messages.  For example, there may be two queues named'MPI ADT~A08', with one for messages being transmitted to another system, andthe other queue of the same name for messages that were received from othersystems.At present this field will automatically default to OUTGOING.  A futureenhancment may support the assignment of priorties for incomming queues.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>applies to all links (yes/no)(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter YES if the priority should be applied to all queues of the given name, regardless of the link the queue is for.It is allowed that even if set to YES, a different priority can be assignedto that queue for specific links, and that priority for the queue/link willoverride the more general one.If this field is set to NO, that means that the PRIORITY field (#.04) is ignored.  A priority can still be assigned to a specific queue by specifyingthe specific link, along with the priority for that queue/link. If it is set to NO or left blank then the queue would assume the defaultpriority of 50, unless overridden in the LINKS multiple.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>priority</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>A priority is an integer between 20 and 100, with a default value of 50.The lower the priority, the less frequently the queue will be serviced.Conversely, the higher a queue's priority the more frequently it will beserviced.  The recommended use of the priority functionality is to reserveits use to the operations staff. A queue's priority should be increasedif experience shows that it tends to get backed up.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>links</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="779_91.html">779.91</a></td><td></td><td>A link is an entry in the HL Logical Link file (#870).
