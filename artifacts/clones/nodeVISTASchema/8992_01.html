Thisid may simply be a package namespace, or it may be a namespace followed byadditional data to more accurately identify the type or purpose of thealert.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>message text</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the text of the message to be presented to the user atthe time when he cycles through the menu system the first time after thealert has been filed for the user, and when the user selects the VIEWALERTS option.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>new alert flag</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:NEW<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag is used by the alert processing to indicate a new alert whichhas not previously been presented to the user.  After the alert messagetext has been shown to the user, this flag is cleared and the user mustthen select the VIEW ALERTS option to process the alert.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>action flag</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>D:DELETE<br/>R:RUN ROUTINE<br/>I:IMMEDIATE RUN<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag is optional at the present time, since the need for actionprocessing can be determined by the presence of an option name or aroutine name for use during alert processing.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>reserved1</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is reserved for future use by the alert system.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>entry point</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>While named ENTRY POINT, this is a dual function field.  If the next field(#.08, AROUTINE NAME) contains a routine name, this field contains thedesired entry point within that routine (this field may also be null,indicating that the entry point should be at the top of the routine).  Iffield #.08 is null, then the contents of this field is interpreted as thename of an option which is to be entered when the alert is processed.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>aroutine name</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If this field is not null, it contains the name of a routine which is tobe used when the alert is processed.  If there is also a value in field#.07, that value is used as an entry point into the routine specified inthis field. If this field is null, field #.07 is interpreted as an option name whichis to be used when the alert is processed. If both this field and field #.07 are null, the alert is processed as aninformation only alert.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>reserved</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is reserved for future use in the alert processing system.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>can delete without processing</td><td>0;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field was added as a flag to identify alerts which the packagesindicate may be deleted by the user without processing the alert.  Thevalue is optional and is passed by the package which generates the alertif they want to give permission for users to be able to delete the alert.The flag is checked in the code handling user deletion of alerts.  If analert involves an action (via an option or routine) it may not be deletedby the user unless this flag is set.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>days for surrogate</td><td>0;13</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>days for supervisor</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>days for backup reviewer</td><td>0;15</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The 'DAYS FOR BACKUP REVIEWER' field contains a number of days, which ifexceeded without the alert being processed will cause the alert to beforwarded to the designated 'XQAL BACKUP REVIEWER' in the PARAMETER filewith a comment indicating that the alert had not been reviewed by theoriginal recipient. This forwarding option is in addition to the SUPERVISOR (based on entriesfor CHIEF in the SECTION/SERVICE file) or e-mail surrogates, and wasrequested by sites to be able to forward unprocessed alerts to a known,interested individual.  This could be someone in Quality Assurance or aspecific nurse responsible for handling overdue unprocessed alerts.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>data for alert</td><td>1;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field and all following ^-separated fields are processed as a singleentity and are returned in the variable XQADATA for use by the applicationwhich generated the alert.  The package may pass a series of variablesusing any desired separator in the variable XQADATA at the time the alertis setup.  When the alert is processed the value of XQADATA is returned tothe application and may be used to establish parameters related to thealert without requiring interaction or provision of information by theuser.  In this way information related to patient entry number, specificinternal numbers for the desired data, etc may be stored and returned.</td></tr><tr><td>2.01</td><td>comment for display</td><td>2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3.01</td><td>guid for gui</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains a Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID) which is used toidentify the application which should be used in a graphical userinterface environment (windows) to process the alert.  This applicationmust implement the IVAlert interface.  The GUID should be of the form   {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx} where each x is a hexadecimal digit (0 through 9 or A through F).</td></tr><tr><td>3.02</td><td>patient</td><td>3;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td></td><td>This field is a pointer value to the PATIENT file, if the alert ispatient related.
