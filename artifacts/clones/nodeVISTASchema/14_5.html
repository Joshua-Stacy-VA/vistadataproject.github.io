The information pertaining to each volume set is primarilyused by the Kernel, especially TaskMan.  The ucis that make up eachvolume set can be determined by using the cross-references in the UCIAssociation Table file.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>ZT</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>volume set(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Answer should be the name of a volume set.When each cpu can have only one volume set, this is also the cpu name.Answer will be used in extended global references to reach this volume.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>type(+)</td><td>0;10</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>G:GENERAL PURPOSE VOLUME SET<br/>P:PRINT SERVER<br/>C:COMPUTE SERVER<br/>O:OTHER NON-TASKMAN VOLUME SET<br/></td><td></td><td>This field describes how TaskMan should treat the volume set.  It takesover many of the 486 configuration functions handled by the Out of Orderand Replacement Volume Set fields in versions 6.5 and 7.0. General Purpose Volume Set:  The Manager on a G type will usually sendtasks back to the volume set where they were created, except that tasksthat explicitly request a different volume set will be sent where theyask.  (Explicit volume set requests are made by using 1) the ZTCPUinput variable to the %ZTLOAD entry point, 2) the CPU (VOL SET)field of the Device file, or 3) the Queued to What Volume Set fieldof the Option file.)  To transfer tasks TO a G type, TaskMan willuse extended global references to copy the task to the destinationTask and Schedule files, and will then remove the task from this side. Print Server:  On a P type, the Manager will run any task it findsunless the task explicitly requests a different volume set.  Tasksare transferred TO a P type the same as to a G type, and Submanagersbehave the same. Compute Server:  Tasks are transferred to a C type by placing the tasks inthe Link Waiting List and jobbing a Submanager across to that volume set.Submanagers started on a C type will only process tasks in the LinkWaiting List for their volume set. File Server and Other Non-TaskMan Volume Set: Tasks sent from or to a F orO type will be rejected. Because of the field's crucial role in guiding TaskMan's behavior, thefield is required.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>inhibit logons?</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/>S:SYSTEM SHUTDOWN<br/></td><td></td><td>Answering YES will cause TaskMan to notify Sign-on that logons are nowprohibited, and to stop processing tasks until logons are allowed again. If set to SYSTEM SHUTDOWN then taskman set this because of a pendingshutdown. Taskman will clear this flag when restarted.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>link access?</td><td>0;3</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer NO to tell TaskMan that this volume set cannot be accessed byother volume sets using the local network links. Tasks that request a volume set without link access are rejected byTaskMan.  Such volume sets are usually PC workstations linked into thelarger network.  They can access the core computers, but cannot be accessedthemselves.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>out of service?</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer YES to temporarily prevent tasks from being sent to this volume set. While a volume set is out of service, tasks that would normally be sentacross the local links to that volume set are either saved until the volumeset is back in service, or sent to a replacement volume set if one isspecified.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>required volume set?</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer YES if TaskMan cannot run without this volume set being accessible. If a volume set serves the files that the rest of the system needs, itshould be a required volume set.  So long as a volume set is required, thenormal mechanisms of handling links that are out of service or dropped arebypassed for that volume set.  Instead, TaskMan waits until the link isrestored before processing any more tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>taskman files uci(+)</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Answer should be the uci that holds the ^%ZTSK and ^%ZTSCH globals.That uci will usually be the library uci, which is usually the manager uci.Answer should not contain a comma and volume set name--just the uci name.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>taskman files volume set</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="14_5.html">14.5</a></td><td></td><td>Answer should be the name of the volume set that holds ^%ZTSK and ^%ZTSCH.If that is the current volume set, you may leave this field blank. This field will usually be used for mounted volume sets that lack libraryucis of their own, and for VAX sites set up according to the VA cookbook.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>replacement volume set</td><td>0;8</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="14_5.html">14.5</a></td><td></td><td>Answer should be a volume set to which tasks can be sent if thisvolume set is unavailable.If tasks that need this volume set should wait, leave the field blank. A replacement volume set should be essentially equivalent in features tothe current one, since tasks that would normally run on this one will berunning on that one instead.  For many volume sets, no other volume set isequivalent, and tasks should wait for the link to be restored rather thanrun elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>days to keep old tasks</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Answer will be used by ZTMQCLEAN option to decide which tasks to delete. If no answer is given, ZTMQCLEAN will keep the last seven days' tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>signon/production volume set</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:No<br/>1:Yes<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter Yes if this Volume Set has the following properties: 1. Users can sign-on into the Kernel Menu system or the RPC Broker Server    routine is running there. 2. Has a productions UCI which contains application routines. 3. The ^XTMP global is translated.If you enter Yes the Kernel Installation and Distribution System will be ableto move routines to this Volume Set.  The Kernel Menu system will be able torun the Menu Microsurgery and keep menus updated.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>re-queues before un-schedule</td><td>0;12</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field holds the number of times that a task to a HFS or SPOOL device will be re-queued for a 5 minute delay before it is un-scheduled.The routine XUTMHR does this work once an hour.  It will send an alert tothe user that queued the task.A value of 12 would be an hour and 288 would be a day.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
