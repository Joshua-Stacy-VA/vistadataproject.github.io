Allowed  units are H (hours) D (days), W (weeks), M(months), and Y (years). If a reminder is only to be given once in alifetime use a frequency of 99Y. The special frequency of 0Y willmake a reminder never due.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>found text</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the text that will be displayed in the Clinical Maintenanceoutput if this finding is found (true).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>not found text</td><td>2;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the text that will be displayed in the Clinical Maintenanceoutput if the finding is not found (false).</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>rank frequency</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used to rank the frequency and age range sets associatedwith a finding. If there is more than one true finding that canoverride the baseline frequency age range set, then the determination ofwhich one to use is made based on the finding with the highest rank.Ranks can range from 1 to 999 with 1 being the highest rank. When the Rank field is blank (null) for all true findings that canoverride the baseline frequency age range set, then the frequency thatwill cause the reminder to be given most often will be used. Forexample, if finding 1 has a frequency of 6 months, and finding 2 has afrequency of 1 year, finding 1 will be used to override the baseline.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>use in resolution logic</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>&:AND<br/>!:OR<br/>&':AND NOT<br/>!':OR NOT<br/></td><td></td><td>This optional field is used to indicate that this finding itemshould be included as part of the resolution logic for thisreminder.

If the resolution logic evaluates totrue, then the last resolution date is determined. The applicablefrequency is added to the resolution date to determine when thereminder is next due. If the resolution logic evaluates to false,then reminder is due.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>use in patient cohort logic</td><td>0;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>&:AND<br/>!:OR<br/>&':AND NOT<br/>!':OR NOT<br/></td><td></td><td>This optional field is used to indicate that this finding itemshould be included as part of the Patient Cohort Logic for thisreminder.

The default logicstring initially includes (SEX)&(AGE), regardless of whether thebaseline specifies SEX and AGE criteria. Each finding item with avalue in the Use In Patient Cohort Logic field is appended to thestring by using the operator and finding item. For example, iffinding item 2 had an operator for this field of "&" then the stringwould be (SEX)&(AGE)&FI(2).After all findings have been evaluated, the finding item is replacedby its true or false value in the cohort logic and the cohort logicis evaluated. If the cohort logic evaluates to true, then the reminderis applicable to the patient. If the cohort logic evaluates to false,then reminder is non-applicable or N/A.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>beginning date/time</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the beginning date/time to search for the finding. Whencombined with the ENDING DATE/TIME, they define a date range inwhich to search for the finding.This can be entered in any of the acceptable FileMan date/timeformats and abbreviations. See the FileMan Getting Started Manual tolearn about acceptable FileMan date/time formats and abbreviations.In addition, you can use the abbreviations T-NY or NOW-NY,where N isan integer and Y stands for years. The date of another finding inthe form FIEVAL(M,"DATE") or FIEVAL(M,N,"DATE") where M is thenumber of the finding and N is an occurrence may also be used. Forexample, FIEVAL(M,"DATE")-3M would set the Beginning Date/Time tothe date of finding M minus three months. Note that when this formis used and finding M is false no Beginning Date/Time can bedetermined so this finding will be set to false.If this field is null, then the beginning date/time will correspondwith the  date/time of the oldest entry in the patient's record.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>use inactive problems</td><td>0;9</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:N<br/></td><td></td><td>Normally only active problems from the Problem List will be used in thereminder evaluation. If USE INACTIVE PROBLEMS is set to YES then bothactive and inactive problems will be used. Note that this field appliesonly to taxonomy findings.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>within category rank</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field applies only to health factors. In order to understandhow it works, you need to understand how health factors work in thereminder evaluation process. If you are not clear about this, seethe health factor section of the Clinical Reminder Manager Manual.The default behavior is to use only the most recent health factorwithin a category. A problem can arise if there are two or morehealth factors within a category and they both have the same date.(This can happen if both health factors are given during the sameencounter).  When the dates are the same, the health factor with thehighest WITHIN CATEGORY RANK will be used. This is a numerical valuelike RANK FREQUENCY, with 1 being the highest rank.If WITHIN CATEGORY RANK has the special value of 0, then thecategorization of health factors will be ignored and the healthfactor will be treated as a distinct finding.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>ending date/time</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the ending date/time to search for findings. When combinedwith the BEGINNING DATE/TIME they define a date range in which tosearch for the finding. The ENDING DATE/TIME must be after theBEGINNING DATE/TIME.This can be entered in any of the acceptable FileMan date/timeformats and abbreviations. See the FileMan Getting Started Manual tolearn about acceptable FileMan date/time formats and abbreviations.In addition, you can use the abbreviations T-NY or NOW-NY,where N isan integer and Y stands for years. The date of another finding inthe form FIEVAL(M,"DATE") or FIEVAL(M,N,"DATE") where M is thenumber of the finding and N is an occurrence may also be used. Forexample, FIEVAL(M,"DATE")+3M would set the Ending Date/Time to thedate of finding M plus three months. Note that when this form isused and finding M is false no Ending Date/Time can be determined sothis finding will be set to false.If this field is null, then the ending date/time will be the end ofday on the reminder evaluation date.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>mh scale</td><td>0;12</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This applies only to Mental Health Instrument findings.

Each type of finding has a specificfield that provides the value available to use in the CONDITION logic.If the finding value is text, enclose the condition value in quotes (e.g., "positive"). If the finding value is numeric, do not use quotes(e.g., 3). An IF statement is used to evaluate the value.  The value is alwaysidentified as V in the statement regardless of the type of finding. If the condition logic statement evaluates to true, the finding is considered as found (true); otherwise the finding is considered as notfound (false). Relational operators that may be used include: = equals, < less than, >greater than, [ contains, ] follows and ? pattern matches. Logicaloperators may be used to check multiple values: & And, !
