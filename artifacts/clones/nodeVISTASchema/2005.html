It is distributed withoutdata.  Objects handled by the VistA Imaging System currently include singleimages (various resolutions), series of images, scanned documents, motionvideo, waveforms, and audio files.  There is a record in file 2005 foreach object, containing the attributes of the object. All fields areautomatically stuffed by the Imaging software - there is no user input.Objects handled by the VISTA Imaging System currently include:   * Single images (various resolutions)  * Series of images  * Scanned documents  * Waveforms   * Motion video  * Audio files  Each object has a natural language Name (.01); this usuallyconsists of the patient's name, ssn, and object description. Depending on the object type, the object will either have:   * A filename and logical location on the network (e.g., single image, graphics).  * A multiple field called Object Group, containing entries, whichpoint back to the Image file (e.g., image series or tiledabstract display).</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>MAG</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>.001 NUMBER Field is the Internal Entry Number of the Image File Entry.i.e. "DA" of the Image File entry.Imaging routines and RPC's use the Image DA for lookups.The Image Files associated with this entry are stored on a Networked ImageA name for the Image Files is generated from the Image DA, the Extension is appropriate to the Type of Image.i.e. I0014432.JPG</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>object name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Each object has a natural language name; this usually consists of thepatient name, social security number, and object description.

An abstract is a miniature copy of the captured image. Ifthe parent image has not been viewed during the specified time period (ifthere is a jukebox), this file will be deleted along with the parent imagefile. Should the abstract be requested for viewing, it will be copied backonto the server currently being used to write captured images.

This field is automatically set by the Imagingsoftware at the time of image capture.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>object group</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="2005_04.html">2005.04</a></td><td></td><td>The object group is a multiple field pointing back to the Image file(2005).  Only objects with an object type of GROUP have the Object Groupfield defined.  These objects can be thought of as the "parent" of a setof images.   Generally, instead of having their own abstract, objects of the GROUP typeuse the abstract of the first entry in their object group multiple.  Sometimes, text will be used in place of the GROUP abstract for speed.  Methods for viewing a GROUP object generally allow viewing of all themembers of the group, either selectively or altogether.  A good examplewould be a set of thirty CT scan images.  Using the Integrated View menuoption, the tiled display of image abstracts would contain only oneabstract for the group.  Selecting the group object for viewing providesthe user with a tiled display of the abstracts of the individual CT scanimages.  The user can then identify individual images for full resolutionviewing.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>patient</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>AC</td><td>This field is a pointer to the VistA Patient file (#2), and contains theDFN of the patient that the image or object belongs to.

It is also permanently written on the upper left corner ofthe image to provide visible identification.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>long description</td><td>3;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This word processing field allows the user to describe the image atlength.  The user may only choose to append this long description onselected images - those which are "classic" or "unusual" cases. It can beused to summarize a group of images which have been put together for aconference or consult.  It will be used in the future to a greater extent,as options for image capture (independent of VistA packages) are provided.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>last access date</td><td>0;9</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date and time the image was last viewed or accessed. Each timean abstract or image is requested for viewing, this field is automaticallyset with the current date and time.  In conjunction with the appropriatesite parameter, this field is used for automatic file migration.  That is,when an image has not been accessed within the predefined time period, itwill be deleted from the magnetic server and will only be accessible fromthe optical disk jukebox.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>iq</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td>AIQ</td><td>This indicates that this image entry has questionable integrity.</td></tr><tr><td>13.5</td><td>dupe</td><td>0;12</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is to allow screening of images thathave duplicate instances in the archive fileand the image file.

It is obtained fromthe Parent Data file (i.e. the date/time of the X-ray exam, the MedicalProcedure, the time the Laboratory specimen was obtained from the patient,or the date/time of the Surgical procedure). This often is not the same asthe date/time the image was captured. In a long surgical procedure theimage capture time may be several hours later than the start of theoperation. When a lab specimen is collected from a patient, it may beseveral days before images are captured from the slide.  If images areinitially stored on an intermediate media such as x-ray film or video tape,the capture time can be long after the procedure time.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>parent data file#</td><td>2;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2005_03.html">2005.03</a></td><td></td><td>The values of fields 16, 17, 18 and 63 are numbers.These numbers are internal entry numbers.

Which fieldcorresponds to which internal entry number is explained below.Together, the values of these fields establish a link backto the entry in the "parent" file, that holds the informationthat describes why the image was collected.The link to the "parent" information is brought about bythe combination of the values of fields 16, 17, and, 18, andoptionally also field 63.The value of field 16 is a number that indicates the internalentry number of the "parent file" in the VA-FileMan data dictionary.Common parent files are:   File    Name   ====    ====     3.9:  MAIL MESSAGE    63:    AUTOPSY (MICROSCOPIC)    63.02: ELECTRON MICROSCOPY    63.08: SURGICAL PATHOLOGY    63.09: CYTOLOGY    63.2:  AUTOPSY (GROSS)    74:    RADIOLOGY   130:    SURGERY   691:    ECHOCARDIOGRAM   691.1:  CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION   691.5:  ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY   694:    HEMATOLOGY   699:    ENDOSCOPY   699.5:  GENERIC MEDICINE  8925:    TIUThe records in each of these "parent" files contain a multiple that itemizesthe list of images that belong to that record.The field numbers and fixed indexes for those multiplesall have the number 2005. The entries within these multiplesall have a field that is a pointer back to the image file.The entries in these multiples identify the various imagesthat belong with the record in question.The various parent files each have their own structure, for instance Type Number     Form of Root ===========     ============     1           ^RARPT(D0,2005,D1,0)=image...     2           ^MCAR(699,D0,2005,D1,0)=image...     3           ^LR(D0,"SP",D1,2005,D2,0)=image...Depending on the nature of the file structure of the parent file,the imaging software will need either just the value of D0 (type1 and type 2) to find the correct entry, or the values of D0 aswell as D1 (type 3).The values of the fields in the image file correspond to thevalues of the indices in the parent file as follows:   Type Number   Field Number and FileMan Index   ===========   ==============================       1         field 17 = D0, field 18 = D1       2         field 17 = D0, field 18 = D1       3         field 17 = D0, field 63 = D1, field 18 = D2In the case of type 3, the value of D0 is equal to thevalue of LRDFN.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>parent association date</td><td>2;11</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the Date that the Document/Image was associated with the Parent Data File.
