Since user class membership includes members of allsubclasses, users should be made members of the most discrete class in ahierarchy of classes.  For example, if Jones is a dentist, Jones should beentered into the Dentist class.  Since Dentist is a subclass of theProvider class, Jones is then automatically a Provider. Persons wearing several different hats can have more than one entry in thefile.  For example, Smith might be a dietician also working toward anursing degree.  Smith could be entered twice, once as a Dietician andonce as a Student Nurse.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>member(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the person to whom membership in a given User Class is being ascribed.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>user class</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8930.html">8930</a></td><td></td><td>This is the User Class to which the User in question is being grated membership.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>effective date</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date on which the user became, or will become a member of the User Class in question.
