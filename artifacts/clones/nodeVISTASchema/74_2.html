The transcriptionist receives the tape and the patient foldersassociated with the reports dictated on the tape. By placing the reportsfor that tape in a single batch, usually by interpreting physician name,the following processes will be improved:          o re-printing the reports if the printer malfunctions.         o verifying the report can be done by batch with the           user only answering the 'report status' prompt for           each report. The system automatically proceeds through           the reports in the batch.         o if more than one transcriptionist has to print his/her reports           on the same printer then batch printing prevents           interweaving of each transcriptionist's reports. Naming of batches is controlled by the user and most often the name is thename of the interpreting physician whose dictation the user istranscribing. A user can only enter reports into a batch that he/shecreated.   Data Storage ------------The data for the 'REPORT BATCHES' file is stored in the ^RABTCH(74.2,global.
