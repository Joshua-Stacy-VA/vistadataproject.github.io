Whereas traditional cross-references are stored under the 1 nodes ofthe ^DD for a particular field, new-style cross-references are stored inthis file and can consist of one field (simple cross-references), as wellas more than one field (compound cross-references).</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>file(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Answer should be the number of the file cross-referenced by this index.For whole file cross-references on subfiles, answer with the number ofthe file where the index physically resides, not the subfile number.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Answer must be the name of the index. For example, the name of the defaultlookup index on a file's .01 field is B, the name of the uniqueness indexof a compound key is BB, and the name of an index not used for lookup muststart with A.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>description</td><td>.1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>short description(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Answer should be text briefly explaining the function of thiscross-reference.</td></tr><tr><td>.2</td><td>type(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>R:REGULAR<br/>MU:MUMPS<br/></td><td></td><td>REGULAR - One or more field values are stored in an index on the file. Theindex can be used for sorting, or optionally, looking up entries. MUMPS - Customizable M code executes whenever a field that makes up thecross-references changes.</td></tr><tr><td>.4</td><td>execution(+)</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>F:FIELD<br/>R:RECORD<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer with the code that indicates whether the cross reference logicshould be executed after a field in the index changes, or only after allfields in a record are updated. The logic for most simple (single-field)indexes should be executed immediately after the field changes, and soshould get the code 'F'. The logic for most compound indexes should beexecuted only once after a transaction on the entire record is complete,and so should get the code 'R'. Exceptions to this rule are rare.</td></tr><tr><td>.41</td><td>activity</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Answer with the flags that control whether FileMan fires thiscross-reference during an installation and a re-cross-referencingoperation. The possible flags are:   I = Installing an entry at a site  R = Re-cross-referencing this index FileMan automatically fires cross-references during an edit, regardless ofActivity, though you can control whether a cross-reference is fired byentering Set and Kill Conditions. Also, if you explicity select a cross-reference in an EN^DIK, EN1^DIK, orENALL^DIK call, or in the UTILITY FUNCTIONS/RE-INDEX FILE option on the VAFileMan menu, that cross-reference will be fired whether or not itsActivity contains an "R".</td></tr><tr><td>.42</td><td>use</td><td>0;14</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>LS:LOOKUP & SORTING<br/>S:SORTING ONLY<br/>A:ACTION<br/></td><td></td><td>LOOKUP & SORTING - The index name starts with "B" or a letter thatalphabetically follows "B".  Calls to Classic FileMan lookup (^DIC) or theFinder (FIND^DIC or $$FIND1^DIC) where the index is not specified willinclude this index in the search. The index will be available for use bythe FileMan Sort and Print (EN1^DIP). SORTING ONLY - The index name starts with "A". Calls to Classic FileManlookup (^DIC) or the Finder (FIND^DIC or $$FIND1^DIC) will not use thisindex unless it is specified in the input parameters. The index will beavailable for use by the FileMan Sort and Print (EN1^DIP). ACTION - The index name starts with "A". This is used for M code thatperforms some actions and does NOT build an index. Therefore, it is notavailable for use by either the Classic FileMan lookup (^DIC), the Finder(FIND^DIC or $$FIND1^DIC) or the Sort and Print (EN1^DIP).</td></tr><tr><td>.5</td><td>root type</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>I:INDEX FILE<br/>W:WHOLE FILE<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer 'I' if the fields that make up the file are defined at the samelevel at which the index is located. Answer 'W' if this is a whole file cross-reference in which the fieldsthat make up the index are defined in a subfile, but the index isphysically located at a parent file level.</td></tr><tr><td>.51</td><td>root file(+)</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>AC</td><td>Answer with the number of the file or subfile where this index is defined.For whole file indexes, answer with the subfile number, not the number ofthe file where the index physically resides.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>set logic(+)</td><td>1;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Answer with the M code that FileMan should execute when the values offields that make up the cross-reference are set or changed.
