Forexample, print sets include several different procedures but not all ofthem will fit on a report header or a label, so a single procedure name isprinted with a '+' to indicate that there are more procedures in the printset.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>mumps code to set variable</td><td>E;E1,240</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the MUMPS code that sets the 'Internal Variable' to theappropriate value.
