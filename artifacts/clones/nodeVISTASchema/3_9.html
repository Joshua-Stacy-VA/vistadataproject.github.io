Messages are numbered sequentially.Numbers may be re-used if numbers get too big.  See field 17.1, MAXDIGITS FOR MESSAGE NUMBER in file 4.3, MailMan Site Parameters, formore information.Numbers appear in the "Query" listing for the message, as<number>@<domain name>, where <number> is the message number for thismessage, and <domain name> is the name of the domain, as defined inthe file 4.3.  This combination of number and domain name uniquelyidentifies ALL messages in the mailman network, and editing controlis such that no two copies of the message at different domains aredifferent; the message is either identical or missing.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>subject(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the subject of the message, and is shown whenever the message isdisplayed.Leading and trailing blanks are deleted.Any sequence of 3 or more blanks is reduced to 2 blanks.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>from(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is who the message is from.  In the case ofa local message, this is the internal entry number of the user in theNEW PERSON file.  In the case of a networked message, it is the user's fullnetwork address, in the format <user@domain>.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>sender</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the message is sent by a surrogate, this field holds the surrogate'sidentity.It is displayed on the message header in parentheses, with the textSENDER: preceding the sender's name.</td></tr><tr><td>1.3</td><td>confirmation requested?</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>y:YES<br/>n:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This specifies whether or not the sender of a message will get anacknowledgement when the message is read by the recipient.</td></tr><tr><td>1.35</td><td>original message</td><td>0;8</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_9.html">3.9</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used for responses only.If this message is a response, this field points to the original message.</td></tr><tr><td>1.4</td><td>sent date/time</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date and time at which this message was sent.  It relatesto the completion of the sending process, not the beginning, as previousversions did.Initiation and initial sending can be separated by days, e.g. due toequipment failure or illness of the sender, the time of the first send,rather than the time message editing began, is retained.</td></tr><tr><td>1.6</td><td>purge date</td><td>0;6</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This message will be set for all recipients to automatically delete onthis date.</td></tr><tr><td>1.7</td><td>message type</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field enables MailMan to differentiate among types of messages.Spooled documents must be handled partially through an interface to the'spooler'.
