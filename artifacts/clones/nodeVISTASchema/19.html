Options arecreated, associated with others on menus, locked, set out-of-order,assigned prohibited times or devices, or given entry/exit actions.  TheEdit Options of Menu Management should be used (instead of VA FileMan)so that the global root (DIC) and other such fields are given the correctvalues.  Options may be tailored by setting FileMan variables via this file. The Order Enter/Results Reporting package is accessed by using the appropriateoption type.  It is cross-referenced by name, menu text, uppercase menu text,type, item, synonym, help frame, out-of-order message, lock, prohibited times,restricted devices, and priority. </dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>XU;XQ</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The formal name of an option, prefaced with the package name. Each option must be preceded by its package prefix (a 2-4 character)code specified in the PACKAGE file, or the letter "Z" or "A".</td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>x action present</td><td>0;15</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td> This field will be set to '1' if the option has an entry action.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>rev key present</td><td>0;16</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td> This field will be set to '1' if this option has a reverse key assigned to it.</td></tr><tr><td>.26</td><td>header present?</td><td>0;17</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is set to 1 by a trigger on field #26 when MUMPS code isentered into it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>menu text(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The name as the option as it will be displayed to the user withinthe menu system.** The 'C' X-ref has been moved to the uppercase field. **</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>uppercase menu text</td><td>U;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>C</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>out of order message</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used to temporarily disable an option.
