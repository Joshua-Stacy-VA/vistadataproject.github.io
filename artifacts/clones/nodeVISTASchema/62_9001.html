Both atomic and cosmic (panel) tests can be selected. The teston the accession must match exactly the test entered in this field. No expandingof panels occurs.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>accession area(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="68.html">68</a></td><td></td><td>COLLECTION FACILITIES: This field is used to designate the accession area to check whensearching for tests to build onto a shipping manifest. If it is blank thenthe building process will skip over this test. HOST FACILITIES:Not used by software at host facilities.</td></tr><tr><td>.025</td><td>division</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>Collecting facilities: If the manifest building process should only build accessions'from a certain division on a manifest then enter the divisionto screen these accessions. The division used here will be thedivision associated with the user who created the accession.This field will allow a site to screen accessions frommultiple divisions, only placing on the manifest an accessionfrom the specified division. Host facilities: This field not used.</td></tr><tr><td>.026</td><td>feeder shipping configuration</td><td>6;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="62_9002.html">62.9002</a></td><td></td><td>Allows the site to indicate that this test is eligible for a manifest related to this shipping configuration if the specimen/test has been received via the designated feeder shipping configuration which was used to receive the specimen. Example: A CBOC ships a specimen/test to the main VistA facility. The main VistA facility then needs to place this specimen/test on another shipping configuration manifest to ship to another laboratory. By designating the feeder shipping configuration this test will only be added to the manifest if it has been received by the laboratory via a manifest related to the feeder shipping configuration.  If the manifest related to the feeder shipping configuration has not been received then the test will not be added to prevent it being placed on a manifest before the specimen has arrived.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>specimen</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="61.html">61</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to determine if a test for a particular specimen typeshould build on the shipping manifest. If left blank, i.e. no entry thenall specimens for this test are eligible for building on a shipping manifest.If a specimen type is entered then the specimen type of the accession mustmatch before the test is eligible for building onto a shipping manifest.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>urgency</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_05.html">62.05</a></td><td></td><td>COLLECTING FACILITIES:If shipping laboratory tests that are a certainurgency, specify the urgency that must match thetest urgency of the accession for the accession/testto be placed on the shipping manifest. HOST FACILITIES: This field is used by LEDI software at the hostfacility to determine the entry in the host site'sURGENCY file (#62.05) to use for ordering when thehost site has more than one entry in the URGENCYfile (#62.05) that maps to the same HL7 PRIORITY. Example: Host site has three urgencies which         map to HL7 PRIORITY: ROUTINE (R). Entry #     Name                LEDI HL7 -------     ---------------     --------  2          PATIENT WAITING     ROUTINE  9          ROUTINE             ROUTINE 10          NO RUSH             ROUTINE  If there is no mapping defined for this field, then the LEDI software will use the last entry in the URGENCY file that maps to HL7 PRIORITY: ROUTINE (R); workload urgencies are excluded. In this case the test would be ordered with a URGENCY of NO RUSH.  If the host site enters a mapping in this field, i.e. ROUTINE then the test will be ordered using the host site's entry for ROUTINE in the URGENCY file when the HL7 PRIORITY matches.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>specimen container(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_91.html">62.91</a></td><td></td><td>COLLECTING FACILITIES:The container used to hold the specimen.
