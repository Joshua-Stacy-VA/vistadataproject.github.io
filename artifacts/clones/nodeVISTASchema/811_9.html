Additional information may be found at the ClinicalReminders web site: http//vista.domain.ext/remindersThis file contains a combination of nationally distributed and localentries.

Nationallydistributed reminder definition names are prefixed with "VA-". TheVA- prefixed reminder definitions cannot be altered by a site, butmay be inactivated so they will not be selectable or evaluated inthe CPRS GUI. Local modifications can be made to any "VA-" reminder definition bycopying the definition to a new one with a unique name and thenmaking modifications to the new definition which meet localcriteria.</td></tr><tr><td>1.2</td><td>print name</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name that is used when the results of a reminder evaluationare displayed.</td></tr><tr><td>1.3</td><td>do in advance time frame</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used to let a reminder become due earlier than thedate determined by adding the frequency to the date when thereminder was last resolved. For example, if the frequency is 1Y (oneyear) and the DO IN ADVANCE TIME FRAME is 1M (one month), thereminder would have a status of "DUE SOON" 11 months after it waslast resolved. After one year has passed, the STATUS would be "DUE".Frequencies have the form IU where I is an integer and U is one ofthe following units: H (hours), D (days), W (weeks), M (months), andY (years).</td></tr><tr><td>1.4</td><td>related reminder guideline</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="811_9.html">811.9</a></td><td></td><td>If a local reminder replaces a national reminder, this field can beused to identify the related national reminder.</td></tr><tr><td>1.6</td><td>inactive flag</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:INACTIVE<br/></td><td></td><td>Reminders that are inactive will not be evaluated. The ClinicalMaintenance component will return a message stating the reminder isinactive and the date when it was made inactive.Other applications that use reminders may use this flag to determineif a reminder can be selected for inclusion.</td></tr><tr><td>1.7</td><td>inactive change date</td><td>0;7</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date and time when the INACTIVE FLAG was last changed. Itis set automatically. Users should never edit this field.</td></tr><tr><td>1.8</td><td>ignore on n/a</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows the user to stop reminders from being printed inthe Clinical Maintenance component if the reminder is N/A. This is afree text field that can contain any combination of the followingcodes: Code  Description A    N/A due to not meeting age criteria. I    N/A due to inactive reminder. R    N/A due to the wrong race. S    N/A due to the wrong sex. *    N/A for any reason.</td></tr><tr><td>1.9</td><td>sex specific</td><td>0;9</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>F:FEMALE<br/>M:MALE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to make a reminder sex specific. If an "F" isentered, the reminder applies only to females. If an "M" is entered,the reminder applies only to males. If it is left blank, then thereminder is applicable to either sex.If CUSTOM COHORT LOGIC is defined and it does not contain SEX, thenthis field will be ignored.</td></tr><tr><td>1.91</td><td>priority</td><td>0;10</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:HIGH<br/>2:MEDIUM<br/>3:LOW<br/></td><td></td><td>REMINDER PRIORITY is used by the CPRS GUI for sorting purposes.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>description</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains a description of the clinical reminder. It isused to document its purpose and intended usage.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>technical description</td><td>2;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>The TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION is for documenting how a reminder issupposed to function and why the definition is set up the way it is.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>baseline age findings</td><td>7;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="811_97.html">811.97</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple is for defining reminder frequency age ranges sets. Itcan be used to specify different frequencies for different ages. Forexample, you could define a frequency of every 3 years for ages 40to 49 as the first age range set, a frequency of every 2 years forages 50 to 59 as the second, and a frequency of once a year for ages60 to 75. With this set the reminder would be due every 3 years forages 40 to 49, every 2 years for ages 50 to 59, and once a year forages 60 to 75.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>findings</td><td>20;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="811_902.html">811.902</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple identifies which finding items to use when evaluating thereminder. Finding items may be categorized into 4 types of findings:age, patient cohort, resolution, and informational. How patient findingsare used depends on the values given to the various fields associated with findings. See the description of those fields to learn what they do.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>function findings</td><td>25;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="811_925.html">811.925</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple is used to define function findings; each functionfinding is labeled by an integer: the FUNCTION FINDING NUMBER. Theuser defines a function finding by inputting a FUNCTION FINDINGNUMBER and associated FUNCTION STRING. Function Findings are thenused in the reminder definition logic by reference to FF(FUNCTIONFINDING NUMBER). For example, if function findings 1 and 2 weredefined, then they could be used in the cohort or resolution logic asFF(1) and FF(2).Function findings can be used in the resolution logic with onecaveat. They do not have a date associated with them; therefore, theresolution logic must be written so that it cannot be made truesolely by a function finding.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>customized cohort logic</td><td>30;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field may be used to define a customized Patient Cohort Logicstring. Typically this is done when the USE IN PATIENT COHORT LOGICfields associated with each finding do not provide the ability tocreate the required logic string. The requirement for custom logicarises when the required logic is more complex than can berepresented by simple concatenation of Boolean logical operators andfindings.Detailed information on how to create the custom logic string can befound in the Clinical Reminders Manager Manual.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>internal patient cohort logic</td><td>31;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is computed by the Clinical Reminders software and shouldnever be edited by hand.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>patient cohort findings count</td><td>32;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is computed by the Clinical Reminders software and shouldnever be edited by hand.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>patient cohort findings list</td><td>32;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is computed by the Clinical Reminders software and shouldnever be edited by hand.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>customized resolution logic</td><td>34;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field may be used to define a customized Resolution Logicstring.

This means the normal date duecalculation that is based on the dates of the resolution findingsand the final frequency is not done. Only the dates of the findingsand the frequencies specified in the Custom Date Due string areused. Any finding that is in the reminder definition can be used inthe Custom Date Due string; it is not limited to those defined asresolution findings.The final age range will still be used to determine if the patientis in the cohort; however, the frequency associated with this agerange is not used. Only the frequencies specified in the Custom DateDue String are used. They are added to the date of the associatedfinding to determine the dates used by either the MIN_DATE orMAX_DATE functions.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>custom date due function</td><td>46;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the function used in the CUSTOM DATE DUE.
