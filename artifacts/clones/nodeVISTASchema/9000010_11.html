These fields may point to other files and routines not deployed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Inclusion of these fields, as designed, was approved by the DBA.  These fields were initially introduced with the release of the VISTA IMMUNIZATION ENHANCEMENTS 1.0 (PX*1*201) for the VistA Immunization Enhancements Project.  Additional fields may be included in later enhancements.    This file contains immunizations specific to a particular visit for a particular patient.  This file contains one record for each immunization. In the VA, if a CPT code is entered into PCE that represents animmunization, than an immunization will automatically be entered in the VImmunization file.  And vice versa, if an immunization is entered into PCEthat has a related CPT code, then a V CPT entry will automatically becreated with the CPT code for the immunization.  The PCE Code Mapping filecontains the definitions of what immunization is related to what CPT code,and vice versa.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>immunization(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a
