By using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)Broker, applications running on client workstations can invoke (call) theprocedures in this file to be executed by the server and the results will bereturned to the client application.Each remote procedure entry is associated with an entry point (ROUTINE withoptional TAG).  Calls to these procedures can include parameters of differentvalue types.  The resulting value of the call can be either a string, a listof strings or a word processing string as indicated by the RETURN VALUE TYPEfield (.04).The remote procedure may be available for use by anyone or its use may berestricted to one or more application.  The range of availability is indicatedby the AVAILABILITY field.  IF THERE IS NO ENTRY IN THE AVAILABILITY FIELD,then the procedure is assumed to be PUBLIC.A remote procedure may be removed from service for a period of time by settingthe INACTIVE field.  A request for use of a procedure which is marked inactivewill result in an error being returned to the originating application.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>tag</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>routine(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>return value type(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:SINGLE VALUE<br/>2:ARRAY<br/>3:WORD PROCESSING<br/>4:GLOBAL ARRAY<br/>5:GLOBAL INSTANCE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field tells RPC Broker how to process the resulting data from the call.SINGLE VALUE: Broker will return the value of the return parameter (first   parameter in the formal list).  For example,       TAG(RESULT)     ;               S RESULT="DOE, JOHN"               QARRAY: Using $ORDER Broker will traverse the return parameter (first   parameter in the formal list), returning all elements of the array.   For example,       TAG(RESULT)     ;               S RESULT(1)="ONE"               S RESULT(2)="TWO"               QWORD PROCESSING: This type is treated exactly the same way as the ARRAY,   with one exception that the WORD WRAP ON field is used to   control whether each line returned is terminated with CR + LF characters.   See WORD WRAP ON field description for more information.GLOBAL ARRAY: Return value parameter should be set to a closed global   reference in ^TMP. The global's data nodes will be traversed using   $QUERY, and all data values on global nodes descendant from the global   reference are returned.  This type is especially useful for returning data   from VA FileMan word processing fields, where each line is on a   0-subscripted node.   Important: The global reference you pass is killed by the Broker at the              end of RPC Execution as part of RPC cleanup. Do not pass a              global reference that is not in ^TMP or that should not be              killed.   This type is useful for returning large amounts of data to the client,   where using the ARRAY type can exceed the symbol table limit and crash   your RPC.   For example, to return sign-on introductory text you could do this,       TAG(RESULT)     ;               M RESULT=^XTV(8989.3,1,"INTRO")               K RESULT(0)  ;this node is not needed               QGLOBAL INSTANCE: Using this type Broker will return the value of a global   node.  For example the following code will return the whole 0th node   from the NEW PERSON file for the current user.       TAG(RESULT)     ;               S RESULT=$NA(^VA(200,DUZ,0))               Q</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>availability</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>P:PUBLIC<br/>S:SUBSCRIPTION<br/>A:AGREEMENT<br/>R:RESTRICTED<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to indicate the availability of the API to varioususers.PUBLIC indicates that the API is available for general use by any package,and it is not necessary to either indicate that the API is being used orto request permission to use it.SUBSCRIPTION indicates that the API is available to those packages thatwish to use it, BUT the package needs to indicate that it is using the APIor subscribing to it.AGREEMENT indicates that the API is available to packages, other than thedeveloping package, only by means of an integration agreement on itsusage.RESTRICTED indicates that the API is not available for reference by anypackage other than the package which developed it.  Entry of the input andreturn parameter information is at the option of the developing package inthis case.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>inactive</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:ACTIVE<br/>1:INACTIVE<br/>2:LOCAL INACTIVE (ACTIVE REMOTELY)<br/>3:REMOTE INACTIVE (ACTIVE LOCALLY)<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to indicate that the RPC is not available for use forsome reason.  An RPC can be marked as completely unusable (1), unusablelocally (2), or unusable remotely (3).  Local use means in the account theuser is logged into; remote use means in an account other than the one theuser is directly logged into (i.e., a 'Remote RPC').  The Broker will notrun an RPC that is marked as unusable in the applicable context.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>client manager</td><td>0;7</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to identify those APIs which may be initiated tocontrol the client or to send data to the client unrelated to requestsfrom the client.  These actions usually require additional information onthe configuration which is present.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>word wrap on</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:FALSE<br/>1:TRUE<br/></td><td></td><td>Affects GLOBAL ARRAY and WORD PROCESSING return value types only. If set toFALSE, all data values are returned in a single concatenated string inResults[0]. If set to TRUE, each array node on the M side is returned as adistinct array item in the Results property of the TRPCBroker.If you're returning some text to the client and you'd rather let thememo box of the client control the wrapping of lines, set WORD WRAP ONto FALSE.  On the other hand, if you want to preserve line breaks as theyexist on the server, set WORD WRAP ON to TRUE.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>version</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>A number to identify the version of the Remote Procedure.  Currently thisnumber is only checked if the Remote Procedure is being run on a foreignserver.  If a version number is passed to the Broker by the applicationrequesting that the Remote Procedure be run on the foreign server, theRemote Procedure will only be run if the value of this field is equal toor greater than the passed version number.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>suppress rdv user setup</td><td>0;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:No<br/>1:Yes<br/></td><td></td><td>This field controls how Remote Data View handles the setup of a user torun the RPC. If the field is set to No or is blank than the remote usersdata will be set up in the New Person file and DUZ for the process will beset to the user. If the field is set to Yes at the remote site the remoteuser data will NOT be entered into the New Person file and DUZ will be setto the Postmaster. This field should not be set to Yes for RPC's that collect patient data.If there is any question about why a RPC has this set to yes contact theDBA for the VA.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>app proxy allowed</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:No<br/>1:Yes<br/></td><td></td><td>This field must be set to Allowed if this RPC is to be run by an APPLICATION PROXY user.The default is to NOT allow access.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>description</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>input parameter</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8994_02.html">8994.02</a></td><td></td><td>Input parameter is what RPC Broker passes into your remote procedure.
