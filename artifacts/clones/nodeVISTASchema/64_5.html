If thisfeature is utilized, the last date the FILEROOM location(s) wereprinted is stored in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>separate file room</td><td>6;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to designate the FILE ROOM Cumulative being printed ona schedule different from the regular cumulative. To utilize this featurethe following needs to be setup.   1. Set field #4, FILE ROOM, to "YES" - this sorts all non-inpatients to     two locations, FILE ROOM1 and FILE ROOM2, based on terminal digit of     SSN.   2. Set field #17, SEPARATE FILE ROOM, to "YES" - this tells the     cumulative that you are printing the FILE ROOM on a schedule     different from the regular cumulative schedule.   3. For regular FILE ROOM patients, set up one or two reports as follows:     If one report  - starting location: FILE ROOM1                        ending location: FILE ROOM2      If two reports -        first report - starting location: FILE ROOM1                        ending location: FILE ROOM1       second report - starting location: FILE ROOM2                        ending location: FILE ROOM2      Define the other fields as with a regular report.   4. If you also want to print certain locations to an alternate file room,     such as a file room at a satellite clinic then perform the following in     addition to #3 above.      Enter the location(s) that you want to print as a separate report location     by entering them in the "SEPARATE REPORT LOCATION, field #6.      Enter in field #1, "ALTERNATE FILE ROOM" the name to use for this file     room. This name will be concatenated with "FILE ROOM".            e.g. "DALLAS OPC would result in file rooms "FILE ROOM_DALLAS OPC1"                 and "FILE ROOM_DALLAS OPC2".                  Note: The "_", underscore is used to insure that these                       locations sort after the regular file room locations.      Two locations for each file room would be created based on terminal digit     of SSN or identifier (non-file #2 PATIENT) similar to the regular file     rooms.      Note: These locations will print on the same schedule as regular file           rooms.      Either set up separate reports to print these locations or utilize reports     defined in step #3 above and alter the ending location to include these     locations.   5. On each report, set the field #3, FILE ROOM REPORT, in the field #2,     REPORT NAME, multiple to "YES".  The cumulative software will check when attempting to print a cumulativefor a location that contains the name "FILE ROOM" the following. If field #17is set to "YES" and the report being run is not set to "YES" for field #3,FILE ROOM REPORT, then it will skip running the cumulative for that location.This is to prevent another report which may print locations "A" thru "Z" fromprinting the file rooms unintentionally. Related fields used in conjunction with this feature are:   # 4 FILE ROOM   #16 FILE ROOM REPORT DATE   # 1 ALTERNATE FILE ROOM in the #6 SEPARATE REPORT LOCATION multiple.   # 3 FILE ROOM REPORT in the #2 REPORT NAME multiple.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
