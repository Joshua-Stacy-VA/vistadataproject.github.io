The thresholds are normally effectiveon December 1.  To simplify implementation VACO has determined thatthe threshold effective 1-Dec-92 would be used for the period from 30-Oct-92to 1-Dec-92. The Medication Copayment Income Exemption from 1992 thru 11/30/96 wasbased on veterans making less than the VBA rate for pension plus Aidand Attendence. With the filing of the 1996 thresholds,  the directive was changed toreflect that the Medication Copayment Income Exemption was to be based onveterans making less than the VBA rate for Basic Pension.  This is thedirective that is still in effect for current rates.    Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>date(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the effective date of this threshold.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>type(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:BASIC PENSION<br/>2:PENSION PLUS A&A<br/></td><td>AC</td><td>These are the types of Thresholds that this entry is for. The Medication Copayment exemption based on income uses theBasic Pension entry from 1996 to the present and usesPension plus A&A threshold for years prior to 1996.. </td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>base rate for veteran(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the rate for a single veteran.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>base rate with 1 dependent(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the amount for the Veteran with 1 Dependent.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>base rate with 2 dependents</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the amount for the Veteran with 2 Dependents.
