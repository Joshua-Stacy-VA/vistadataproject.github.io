The only requirementsof the system are the following:           o there must be a status with an order of '1'; this is the            status that the module will place an exam in upon registration.           o there must be a status with an order of '9'; when an exam            reaches this status then the module considers the exam            complete and the exam can no longer be called up by case            number; also the case number can then be reused.           o there must be a status with an order of '0' and it must            be called 'CANCELLED'.  Data Storage ------------The data for the EXAMINATION STATUS' file is stored in the ^RA(72,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates ---------------The following is a list of input templates used by the packageand the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:                      Compiled Name                Routine      Description; Option(s)------               -------      ---------------------- RA STATUS ENTRY                 Used to enter/edit entries in this file;                                 RA EXAMSTATUS  This input template should not be modified.  Print Templates ---------------The package does not use any print templates associated with thisfile.  Sort Templates --------------The package does not use any sort templates associated with thisfile.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>status(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name given to the current exam status beingdefined.
