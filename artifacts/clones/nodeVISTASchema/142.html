Components from theHealth Summary Components file (142.1) may be selected and restricted bynumber of occurrences or time limits. The original creator of a type of Health Summary is the owner of that type.  Health Summaries that are"owned" may not be modified or deleted by anyone else, except the ClinicalCoordinator.  "Owned" Health Summaries may be used by other users toprint patient information.    The GMTSMGR security key is included on generic Health Summaries sent out with the Health Summary Package.  These types of Health Summaries should not be deleted. Fields 2,3,4,5 and 6 are used ONLY by Indian Health Service.Specifically, fields 4 (MEASUREMENT PANEL) and 6 (SURVEILLANCE PANEL)point to files 9001017 and 9001018 respectively, which WILL NOT bepresent at non-PCC sites.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the NAME of the Health Summary Type.

Hard copy prints fromthe Reports tab of CPRS, List Manager, and the GMTS print options are affected. The DOB can be removed and the SSN restricted based on the value of this field. A value of '0' or null allows the full 9-digit SSN to display alongwith the DOB; flag value of '1' removes the DOB and only displays the last four of the SSN; and '2' will remove both the SSN and DOBfrom the report header. Viewing predefined health summary reports on screen via GMTS print options or CPRS GUI windows are NOT affected by this flag.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
