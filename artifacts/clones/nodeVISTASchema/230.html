It works together with the ED LOG HISTORY file to track when activities of atypical emergency department visit are done.  It records where the patientwent, who was responsible, and when key things happened (such as triageand disposition). This file serves as the key source of information for data that isdisplayed on the emergency department display board (an electronic "whiteboard").  Patient visits that are currently active are shown on thedisplay board.  The display board is refreshed every 30 seconds.  Many ofthe indexes in this file assist in making the refresh code as efficient aspossible.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>log entry time(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the date/time that this log record was added to the file.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>institution(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>This allows the log entry to be associated with the station that originated it.
