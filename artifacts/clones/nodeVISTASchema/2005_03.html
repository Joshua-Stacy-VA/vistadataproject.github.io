Using these fields along with thePARENT DATA FILE, backward navigation is possible whether it be to amultiple of a file, or a multiple of a sub-file of a file. Each image thatis captured is associated with a procedure or test report.  Depending onthe service collecting the image, different types of reports will beassociated.  For example:   * Medical Procedures:  Endoscopy, Dermatology, Hematology, Rheumatology, etc.  * Anatomic Pathology:  Surgical Pathology, Cytology, Autopsy, Electron Microscopy  * Radiology:  Xray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound  * Surgery  Operation reports  * Text Integration Utility  Progress notes  In order to be able to display information from the associatedreport, references to that report are stored in the Image file. One of these references is a pointer to the Parent Report file(2005.03), which contains an entry for each package's report filethat is currently supported.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>MAG</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>file/subfile number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the actual number of a file or sub-file of a file.

For example the Radiology entryhas 74 for the .001 field and 74 for this field.
