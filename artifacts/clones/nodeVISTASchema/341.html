Thisfile should NEVER be edited directly.  Eventually all types of eventswill be stored in this file as the Accounts Receivable package movesto a transaction-based system. Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>event identifier(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is a unique identifier of an event logged into the AR Eventfile.  Usually the first 3 numbers will be the station number followedby a dash.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>type of event(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="341_1.html">341.1</a></td><td></td><td>The event type describes the type of event that occurred for a debtorby storing all events that occur for this debtor.  This allows betterreporting capabilities, financial integrity, and history recreation. In version 4.0 of AR, the only types of events that are tracked underthis new system are notification type events (letters, UBs, and patientstatements) and comments.  Eventually, payments, refunds, etc. willbe tracked in this new file but are currently being tracked in theAccounts Receivable transaction file.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>debtor(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="340.html">340</a></td><td></td><td>This debtor field is used to store what debtor this event belongs to.By storing events by debtor, this will allow a more efficientsystem when trying to re-create the activity for a debtor account.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>date/time of event(+)</td><td>0;6</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>The Date/Time of event represents the date the event occurred.  Forexample, if a user is logging a comment against a debtor account forthe previous day, then this field would be dated for that day andnot the day it is being entered.  This allows the user to back-dateevents that occurred in the past.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>date/time closed(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>The date/time an event is closed is the time the AR package 'recognizes'the event as being closed and complete.  An event has two status, OPENand CLOSED.  While a transaction is in a status of 'OPEN' the AR packagedoes not recognize the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>created by</td><td>0;8</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td></td><td>This is the person that caused the event to be created.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>site(+)</td><td>0;9</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>The site field represents the site that the event belongs to.  Thisfield would be used when multiple divisional sites are supported and willallow events to be 'traced' to a particular site.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>status(+)</td><td>0;11</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:OPEN<br/>1:CLOSED<br/></td><td></td><td>The status of an event is either OPEN or CLOSED.  When an event fora debtor is in an 'OPEN' status, this means that activity is occurringand has not completed.  After the activity is completed, the eventwould be changed to a status of CLOSED.</td></tr><tr><td>1.01</td><td>principal amount</td><td>1;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the principal amount of the event if applicable.Some events, such as comment type events, do not have a dollar amountassociated with the event.</td></tr><tr><td>1.02</td><td>interest amount</td><td>1;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the interest amount of the event if applicable.Some events, such as comment type events, do not have a dollar amountassociated with the event.</td></tr><tr><td>1.03</td><td>administrative</td><td>1;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the administrative amount of the event if applicable.Some events, such as comment type events, do not have a dollar amountassociated with the event.</td></tr><tr><td>1.04</td><td>court amount</td><td>1;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the court cost amount of the event if applicable.Some events, such as comment type events, do not have a dollar amountassociated with the event.</td></tr><tr><td>1.05</td><td>marshal amount</td><td>1;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the marshal cost amount of the event if applicable.Some events, such as comment type events, do not have a dollar amountassociated with the event.</td></tr><tr><td>2.01</td><td>comment</td><td>2;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field gives the user the ability to give expanded comments foran event or the reason the event occurred or to better describe theevent. For example, if a patient called on the phone, an event could be loggedto describe the call and what was discussed with the patient.</td></tr><tr><td>4.01</td><td>brief comment(+)</td><td>4;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>A brief comment may exist for certain types of events that can be enteredby the user.  A brief comment would consist of a short summary to betterdescribe the reason for the event.</td></tr><tr><td>4.02</td><td>follow-up date</td><td>4;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>AE</td><td>Comment type transactions that are entered by the user can have anoptional follow-up date.  The follow-up date will allow the AR packageto remind the user, via a nightly report, to take some action basedon the event. For example, if a patient calls and needs information that is not readilyavailable, a user can enter as a comment with a follow-up date as a'reminder' to return the information to the patient.</td></tr><tr><td>5.01</td><td>bill number</td><td>5;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="430.html">430</a></td><td></td><td>If the event type is related to a bill in the Accounts Receivable file,then the bill number will be stored in this field.  For now, theonly events that will contain a bill are notification type events.</td></tr><tr><td>5.02</td><td>notification number</td><td>5;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:FIRST<br/>2:SECOND<br/>3:THIRD<br/>4:LAST<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used when a notification is sent to a debtor.
