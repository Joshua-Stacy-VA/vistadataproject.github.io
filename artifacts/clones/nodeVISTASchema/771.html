Vista application names must be namespaced and unique.Answer must be 3-120 characters in length.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>active/inactive</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>a:ACTIVE<br/>i:INACTIVE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates whether the DHCP application is currently active.  ADHCP application should be inactivated when application updates are takingplace. The HL7 package will not accept messages from an inactive SENDINGAPPLICATION. An error will be returned from the call to GENERATE^HLMA.Also, it will not hand off inbound messages to an inactive RECEIVINGAPPLICATION. An error status will be logged.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>facility name</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This information will be placed in the FACILITY ID field of the HL7message header if present. This information will override thedefault facility id information whenever the FACILITY ID REQUIRED field ofthe subscriber protocol is set to YES.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>mail group</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_8.html">3.8</a></td><td></td><td>Vista applications may use this field to generate Mailman notificationswhen messaging problems are detected. To retrieve this mailgroup, seedocumentation for the API, GETAPP^HLCS2.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>*hl7 segment</td><td>SEG;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="771_05.html">771.05</a></td><td></td><td>This is applicable to HL7 v1.5 interfaces only.

Enter the HL7 messagesused by the DHCP application.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>country code</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="779_004.html">779.004</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the country code associated with this application.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>hl7 field separator</td><td>FS;E1,2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The field separator separates two adjacent fields within a segment.  Italso separates the segment ID from the first data field in the segment.The field separator can be defined differently for each HL7 message.  Thefourth character in the MSH segment serves as the field separator forall segments in the HL7 message. If this field is left blank, the default will be the '^' character.However, most messaging applications use the '|' as a field separator. Note that the character used as a field separator CANNOT be reused as oneof the HL7 ENCODING CHARACTERS. If you choose the default '^' as afield separator then choose the default encoding characters as well(~|\&). If you choose the vertical bar as a field separator, then simplyreplace the vertical bar in the encoding characters with the '^', i.e.,~^\&. Due to Fileman limitations, the '^' cannot be the first character inthe encoding character string.</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>hl7 encoding characters</td><td>EC;E1,4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If this field is left blank, the default encoding characters will be setto, "~|\&". Note that if you choose this default, the FIELD SEPARATOR mustbe set to "^". If you choose the vertical bar ("|") as a field separator,enter "~^\&" as your encoding characters. This will avoid a potentialconflict with VA Fileman. Up to four encoding characters may be defined. Each encoding charactermust be unique and none of the encoding characters may be the same as thefield separator character. Each encoding character serves a specificpurpose. The first encoding character is the component separator.  Some datafields may be divided into multiple components.  The component separatoris used to separate adjacent components within a data field. The second encoding character is the repetition separator.  Some datafields may be repeated multiple times in a segment.  The repetitionseparator character is used to separate multiple occurrences of a field. The third encoding character is the escape character.  Data fieldsdefined as text or formatted text may include escape sequences.  Theescape character is used to separate escape sequences from the actualtext. The fourth encoding character is the sub-component separator.  Some datafields may be divided into components, and each component may be furtherdivided into sub-components. The sub-component separator is used toseparate adjacent sub-components within a component of a field. Note that the character used as a field separator CANNOT be reused as oneof the HL7 ENCODING CHARACTERS. If you choose the default '^' as afield separator then choose the default encoding characters as well(~|\&). If you choose the vertical bar as a field separator, then simplyreplace the vertical bar in the encoding characters with the '^', i.e.,~^\&. Due to Fileman limitations, the '^' cannot be the first character inthe encoding character string.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
