Each name in this file corresponds to the right sideof a MailMan address-the part following the "@". Domains may have synonyms, allowing users to name sites with one name,while MailMan uses the more formal Domain Naming conventions. This file also controls whether messages are queued for immediate transmissionand into what queue they are dropped.  Any domain may have a relay domain,which controls the routing as follows: If a domain has a named relay domain, the message is put in the queue forthe relay domain. If not, and the domain has a TRANSMISSION SCRIPT, then the message is putin the queue for that domain. Otherwise, the message is put in the queue for the Parent domain, as definedat MailMan initialization time.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>XM</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This name is the exact name of the domain, as used in network addressing.It consists of "." (dot) pieces that are formed hierarchically starting atthe right.  Domains with dot pieces to the left are administered by thedomain whose domain name consists of its name less the 1st dot piece.For example:  A.DOMAIN.COM is administered by DOMAIN.COM. The domain name may be from 1 to 64 characters.Each dot piece may be up to 20 characters, and must begin with an alphaor numeric, and be composed of only alpha, numeric, or "-" characters.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>flags</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The flags field controls the flow of messages to this domain from thelocal node.  Flags are: S = Send.  MailMan should start a TaskMan task to transmit the messageas soon as the message is received. C = Close.  MailMan will not allow users to address mail to this domain. Q or "" (the null string) = Queue.  MailMan will not deliver until atask is explicitly created to deliver the mail. P = Poll.  A TaskMan task will poll all domains with this flag. N = NO-forward.  MailMan will not allow messages to be forwarded to thisdomain. T = Talkman enabled.  The presence of this flag allows Talkman to be used at your site.  It is also necessary to put a 'T' command intothe script so that TalkMan will be invoked properly.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>security key</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field, if defined, names a security key which must be held by the sender.

This meansthat the sending domain must open the link.  This allows an extra measure of security, to insure that the sending domain establishes thelink.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>relay domain</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4_2.html">4.2</a></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the domain, if any, to which messages are to bealways routed.  For example, if traffic from Los Angeles to Washingtonis always to be routed through San Francisco, then the RELAY DOMAIN forLos Angeles is defined to be San Francisco.   The relay domain overides any other path determination processes, suchas scripts and parent domains.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>transmission script</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4_21.html">4.21</a></td><td></td><td>See the Technical Description for how this field is used in implicitrouting by the name server.

If there's nodevice named in that field, then there is no device.If this domain has a physical link such as a miniengine port,a direct line to another cpu, a modem, etc., this port should be namedin this field to direct network mail to the proper output device.There must be an entry in the DEVICE file for this cpu port.  The namefield of the DEVICE file can be a literal (such as MINIENGINE-OUT orCPU B LINK) but the $I field must match with the correct cpu $I.If the link is physically located on a cpu other than the one the networkmail is being sent from, the local DEVICE file MUST reflect that in theOTHER CPU field of the device file if the transmission is to take placeimmediately.  If it is not identified properly, the message will go intoa queue to be processed the next time a network message is sent from orrecieved on the processor with the physical link.NOTE:  The DEVICE files on all cpu's must have matching device namesto correctly route the message to the proper cpu for sending.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>level 1 name</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>The most right "." piece of a domain name ($P(domain-name,".",$L(domain-name,"."))</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>level 2 name</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>$P(domain-name,".",$L(domain-name,".")-1)</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>level 3 name</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>$P(domain-name,".",$L(domain-name,".")-2)</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>level 4 name</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>$P(domain-name,".",$L(domain-name,".")-3)</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>*network device</td><td>3;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>SEE FIELD 7 ABOUT '*'.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>*transmission task#</td><td>3;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The transmission task# points to the TaskMan task that has been generatedto handle delivery of messages to the domain in background. SEE FIELD 7 ABOUT '*'.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>directory requests flag</td><td>50;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>AE</td><td>This field controls whether or not the XMMGR-DIRECTORY-ALL optionwill send a message requesting the user directory for the domain. If the value is null or zero, no request will be made.If the value is a positive integer, a request will be madeat the same time as other domains with the same number in thisfield are made.
