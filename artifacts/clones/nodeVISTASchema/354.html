The option Manually Change Copay Exemption (Hardships) canbe used to update and correct this entry by creating a new exemption.If many patient records have problems the option Print/Verify PatientExemption Status can be used to correct the entries. The data in this file is updated each time a new (current) exemptionis created for a patient.  Exemptions are automatically created whenchanges in patient information change the exemption status or whenan expired (older than 1 year) exemption is encountered when determiningthe exemption status for pharmacy. This file will contain specific information related to billing aboutindividual patients.  Current Status of the Medication Copayment Exemptionwill be kept in this file.  Conceptually this is different than theBILLING EXEMPTIONS File which maintains the audit log and historical datarelated to billing exemptions. Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>patient name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the patient as it appears in the patient file.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>copay exemption status date(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>AD</td><td>DO NOT EDIT THIS FIELD.
