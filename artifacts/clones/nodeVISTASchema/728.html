This data includes the last date an extract wasrun, the Austin queue receiving the extract data, and extract setupinformation. Data in this file should be entered and edited only by using the DSSsoftware and not by direct access via VA FileMan. **TECH NOTE**When adding a new extract, make sure that the "LAST DATE XXX" is onsame piece of the 7 node as the "XXX" field is on the 7.1 node.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains a pointer to the corresponding location (station number)entry in the INSTITUTION file (#4).</td></tr><tr><td>.5</td><td>lab lmip</td><td>LMIP;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is a flag that indicates whether a facility is ready to send LMIP codes for the LAB Extract. To answer "YES" to this question, the site must be able to answer "YES" to BOTH of the following questions: 1. They are in DSS Implementation Round 5 or higher, OR they are in IR1    through IR4 and are extracting data for FY97 or beyond.2. All Lab CO directives for LMIP have been completed at their facility.   This means that their Lab Service has matched all entries in the    LABORATORY TEST file (#60) to an LMIP code and therefore they are    ready to use the new DSS LAB Extract version that sends only the LMIP    codes to DSS for their initial LAB Feeder Key Values. **NOTE** Once this field is set to "YES", the facility is not asked any of these questions again and will automatically use the new DSS LAB Extract version for all future extracts.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>last date
