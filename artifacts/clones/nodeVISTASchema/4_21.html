The higher the number the lower thepriority for being chosen.  See also the Number of Attempts field.When MailMan is transmitting using the TCP/IP Poller (XMRTCP), itassumes that there is only one  possible TCP/IP connection per domain anddoes not look for multiple scripts to roll over to.  This field is onlyoperable for SMTP type scripts (using standard asynchronous WAN connections).PRIORITIES can go from 0 to 9999 where 0 is the highest and 9999 is thelowest.  If the field has no value, 9999 is assumed.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>number of attempts</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>MailMan tests against this field to determine how many times it shouldtry a particular protocol before giving up and trying the next one.This field is used in conjunction with the Priority field.  When thethe Number of tries to transmit the messages in the queue exceeds the valueof this field, a Transmission Failure bulletin is sent to the Postmaster.This field is only active with the SMTP type of transmission script.</td></tr><tr><td>1.2</td><td>type</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>FTP:File Transfer Protocol<br/>SMTP:Simple Mail Transfer Protocol<br/>TELNET:Interactive / TalkMan<br/>TCPCHAN:TCP/IP Channel<br/>OTHER:OTHER<br/></td><td></td><td>Each transmission script must be given a type so that itcan be handled properly.asynchronous connections on the WAN are of the type IDCU.  These scriptsmay compete with each other according to their priorities (See thePRIORITY field).  Scripts that use TCP/IP channels should be markedwith the type TCPCHAN so that they are ignored during prioritizationunless the TCP/IP enabled CPUs have Task Manager running on them, inwhich case they should be made SMTP type. In other words, if the physical link is on a CPU that Task Manager runson the transmission script can be of the type SMTP.  If it is not on sucha CPU another type must be chosen. Other types are TELNET (used for TalkMan or other interactive scripts),FTP (for File Transfers) and Other.</td></tr><tr><td>1.3</td><td>physical link / device</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The physical link is the channel that the transmission will take placeon.  This field is always a free text pointer to the device file.See field 17 / Physical Link Device for more information. </td></tr><tr><td>1.4</td><td>network address (mailman host)</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The network address is that identifier that, used appropriately on thephysical link, allows specification of the system to be contacted.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>out of service</td><td>0;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:in service<br/>1:out of service<br/></td><td></td><td>This is the preferred field to set to take a script out of service,to prevent it from being used.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>text</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the text of the script.
