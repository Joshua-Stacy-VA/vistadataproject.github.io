Theparameter switches allow the 'customizing' of the module for each typeof imaging. WARNING:  ENTRIES SHOULD NOT BE DELETED FROM THIS FILE.  Data Storage ------------The data for the 'IMAGING TYPE' file is stored in the ^RA(79.2,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates ---------------The following is a list of input templates used by the package andthe entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:                      Compiled Name                Routine  Description; Option(s) ----                -------  ---------------------- RA IMAGE PARAMETERS          Used to specify timeout seconds and whether                              the hardware system the module is running on                              is under fail-soft mode;                              RA FAILSOFT  RA ON-LINE CRITERIA          Used to indicate how long certain data should                              remain on file before it can be purged;                              RA PURGE If any modifications to these input templates are needed for localpurposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logicin the template.  Print Templates --------------- The following is a list of print templates used by the package:  Name                  Description; Option(s) ----                  ---------------------- RA ACTIVITY LOG       Prints a list of the activity log entries for the                       imaging type;</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>type of imaging(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name of this type of imaging.  DO NOT ADD, EDIT ORDELETE imaging type names; this will cause problems between theRadiology/Nuclear Med and Order Entry interface.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>activity log cut-off</td><td>.1;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the imaging type parameter that tells the purgeroutine of the module how many days to keep the various activity logson-line.  The amount of days is a whole number between 90 and 99999 and isdetermined at each site by the package coordinator and the computersite manager.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>report cut-off</td><td>.1;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the imaging type parameter that tells the purgeroutine of the module how many days to keep the reports on-line.  Thereport 'impression' will always stay on-line even after the reportsare purged.  The amount of days is a whole number between 90 and 99999and is determined at each site by the package coordinator and thecomputer site manager.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>clinical history cut-off</td><td>.1;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the imaging type parameter that tells the purgeroutine of the module how many days to keep the clinical historyof the visit on-line.  The amount of days is a whole number between 90 and99999 and is determined by the package coordinator and the computersite manager.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>tracking time cut-off</td><td>.1;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field applies to sites that are using the tracking function of thesystem to record when the exam status changes from one status to another.It contains the imaging type parameter that tells the purge routine ofthe module how many days to keep the 'tracking time' information on-line.The amount of days is a whole number between 90 and 99999 and isdetermined at each site by the package coordinator and the computersite manager.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>order data cut-off</td><td>.1;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the imaging type parameter that tells the purgeroutine of the module how many days to keep the orders on-line.

It isbetween 1 and 4 characters in length and is used as a cross reference andfor quick look ups. DO NOT CHANGE ABBREVIATIONS; changing abbreviationswill cause problems between the Order Entry and Radiology/Nuc Medinterface.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>operating conditions(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>N:NORMAL<br/>E:EMERGENCY(NORMAL COMPUTER DOWN)<br/></td><td>AC</td><td>This field contains the hardware conditions parameter that tells the systemthe type of operating conditions that are in effect.  The availableconditions are: 'N' for normal and 'E' for emergency. Under NORMAL conditions, the system uses the parameters set upin the 'Imaging Locations' file to determine which input and printerdevices to use.  Under EMERGENCY conditions, the system ignores all thelocation parameters set up and the user is prompted for this information.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>radiopharmaceuticals used?</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to determine if radiopharmaceuticals will be usedfor this imaging type.  If so, then the nuclear medicine logic paths ofthis software will be triggered at all appropriate points.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>next case number</td><td>CN;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used to contain the next available case number for thistype of imaging.  Case numbers are generated by the system in sequentialorder and are available for reuse the following week after the exam statusbecomes complete.  Case numbers are recycled on Sunday at 12:01 AM.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>case number turnover date</td><td>CN;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the date the case numbers are scheduled to be recycled.This date will always be the next Sunday's date.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>introduction text</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field provides a quick installation guide to be displayed when therad/nuc med system is initialized or reinitialized.
