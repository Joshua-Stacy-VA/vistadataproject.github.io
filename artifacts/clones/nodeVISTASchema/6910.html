If a device has an entry for estimated PM hours AND an entryfor responsible tech, the labor cost will be taken from the EngineeringEmployee File (No. 6929). If there is an entry for estimated hours butNO entry for responsible tech, then this hourly figure will be used tocompute total labor cost.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>delete pm work orders?</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Setting this field to 'YES' will cause PM work orders to be deleted fromthe system at close out time. Deletion of PM work orders is stronglyrecommended for sites that are short on disk space. The PMI will be postedto the equipment history (File 6914) before the actual work order isdeleted.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>temporary work order section</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="6922.html">6922</a></td><td></td><td> Intended for use at sites that allow direct entry of Engineering workorders by end-users. Since assignment of work requests to specific shopsis an Engineering responsibility; 'electronic work orders' are initiallydirected to a 'fictitious shop' (or receiving area). Engineering shouldclean out a receiving area at least once a day. Electronic work ordersmay be transferred to working shops or disapproved. The system will keep a permanent record of the number originally assignedto each work order. This number may always be used to look up the request,no matter how many times it's transferred. Initial requesters may edit their requests; but not after Engineering has transferred them. 'Fictitious' shops should have numbers in the range of 90 to 99, 190 to199, 290 to 299, 390 to 399, 490 to 499, 590 to 599, 690 to 699, 790 to799, 890 to 899, and 990 to 999 inclusive. Multi-division sites may havemore than one receiving area. If there is more than one receiving area ANDif this field (TEMPORARY WORK ORDER SECTION) is left blank; end-users willbe asked to specify the appropriate receiving area when they enter a workorder.</td></tr><tr><td>5.1</td><td>incoming inspection section</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="6922.html">6922</a></td><td></td><td>Engineering section that receives all incoming inspection work orders. This optional field is intended for use at sites that allow incominginspection work orders to be generated during new equipment entry. Theshop for these work orders will default to the shop specified here. Ifthis field is left blank, the default work order shop will be theRESPONSIBLE SHOP for the equipment (if available) or a Receiving Area shop(similar to electronic work orders). Note that users who hold the ENPMsecurity key can select any shop for these work orders. See the Software Option 'ASK INCOMING INSPECTION W.O.' for additionalinformation.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>region</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The VA Region (1 thru 4) in which facility is located.
