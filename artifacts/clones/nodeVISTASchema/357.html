If this file should accidentally         be re-indexed, use the option to Recompile All Forms.  This will         correct any printing problems that might occur. This file contains the descriptive information about an encounter form.  Anencounter form is composed of many encounter form blocks.  Encounter formblocks contain all the data and lists that appear on the form.  The datafrom this file along with the other encounter form files is used to designand print encounter forms.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td> The name of the encounter form.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>simplex/duplex</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:SIMPLEX<br/>1:DUPLEX,LONG-EDGE BINDING<br/>2:DUPLEX,SHORT-EDGE BINDING<br/></td><td></td><td>  Allows forms to be printed either one-sided or two-sided. SIMPLEX - refers to a form that will print on one side of the paper.DUPLEX  - refers to a form that will print on both sides of the paper.  .SHORT-EDGE BINDING - prints from top to bottom on the front page and   prints from bottom to top on the back page.  .LONG-EDGE BINDING  - prints from top to bottom on the front page and   prints from top to bottom on the back page.  </td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>brief description(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td> A brief description of the contents of the form and its intended use.

(prompted as 'Should ICR be used to auto-   matically read hand print on this form?') should be set to YES. It is   anticipated that the scanning software will include intelligent recog-   nition software (ICR) for reading hand print in future package releases.3) A form can be designed with scannable and non-scannable pages. Each page   to be scanned should have the SCANNABLE? field set to YES. For each page   selected in the PAGE INFORMATION multiple, the SCANNABLE? field is auto-   matically set to YES.4) Selection lists should use bubbles as marking areas. The selection rule   should be appropriate to the type of data. The selection rule will be   enforced by the scanning software. For example, if a diagnosis list has   the selection rule AT LEAST ONE, the form will be flagged as invalid if   no diagnosis is selected. Also, the proper data qualifier, if one    applies, should be entered. An example illustrating the use of data   qualifiers is a selection list for diagnosis codes where there is a sub   column for selecting the primary diagnosis and another sub column for   selecting secondary diagnoses. At the bottom of the selection list an   area can be created to contain 'other' codes not found on the list.5) All hand print to be scanned must use hand print fields, except for the   'other' feature of selection lists.6) The PACKAGE INTERFACE file (357.6) contains the complete list of data   that is currently scannable.  There are several forms that are included with AICS v3.0 that are scan-nable. There are also a number of tool kit blocks included that weredesigned to be scannable. The best approach to creating the forms neededby your facility is to first develop a few basic forms, without clinicspecific coding, suited to your site's needs. Those forms can then beplaced in your tool kit and used as the basis for developing the rest ofyour forms.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  If ANY page of the form is to be scanned into VISTA, enter YES.    .Individual pages of the form to be scanned are selected later     at the PAGE INFORMATION prompt. If NONE of the form pages are to be scanned into VISTA, enter NO. </td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>form type id</td><td>0;13</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>ADEF</td><td>This is the current form definition entry associated with this form.
