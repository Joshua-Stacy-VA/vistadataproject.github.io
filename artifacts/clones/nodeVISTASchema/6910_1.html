As a rule, only hardcopy print devices shouldbe contained in this file. The intent is to discourage users frominadvertently sending output to a CRT or some other device not intendedfor printing.  This file also contains device-specific instructions for customizedformats and data layouts for use when printing bar coded equipment andlocation labels from AEMS/MERS. It is quite conceiveable for more thanone entry in the Engineering Computer Port file to point to the sameentry in the Device file (#3.5), the difference could be the bar codeinstructions.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>device #(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td>B</td><td>Pointer to DEVICE file.
