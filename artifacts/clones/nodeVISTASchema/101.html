In HL7, the message type and event type of an applicationresponse message may be different from the original message. If this is an event point protocol, enter the event typecorresponding to the initial message generated by the SENDING APPLICATION.  If this is a subscriber protocol, then enter the event type correspondingto the RECEIVING APPLICATION response. Note that an event type is notrequired when responding with a general acknowledgement (ACK) and thereceiving application does not always need to generate a response. NOTE: 1. In "original acknowledgement mode" the receiving application alwaysgenerates the response.2. In "enhanced acknowledgement mode" the HL7 package may be configured toproduce a "commit ack" before the application receives the message. If thereceiving application does not need to generate a response in addition tothe ack, then the event type is the same as the original message (and themessage type would be ACK)3. In "enhanced acknowledgement mode with two-phase commit" the HL7package generates a commit ack, and passes the message to the application.The second phase of the transaction occurs when the application is readyto initiate a response. This is interpreted as the start of a newtransaction and may require a commit ack itself.</td></tr><tr><td>770.5</td><td>message structure</td><td>770;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="779_005.html">779.005</a></td><td></td><td>The message structure is associated with the message type and event type defined by HL7 v2.3.1 and beyond.</td></tr><tr><td>770.6</td><td>processing id</td><td>770;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>D:debug<br/></td><td></td><td>This field describes how a message should be processed once it is handedoff to the receiving application.  PROCESSING ID is a required field in the HL7 message header. However, theEvent Driver protocol entry is only used whenset to DEBUG. Data for theheader is normally derived from the HL COMMUNICATION SERVER FILE. Iftesting a transaction in Debug mode, make sure it is changed on both thesending and receiving system.  The receiving application developer should consider checking this portionof the header before filing data on a production system. Training andDebug messages may not be suitable for filing.</td></tr><tr><td>770.7</td><td>logical link</td><td>770;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="870.html">870</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used with a SUBSCRIBER PROTOCOL to describe the network pathto the subscriber.
