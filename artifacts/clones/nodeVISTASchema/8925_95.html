(For example, if you Require Release for classProgress Notes, then all progress note titles require release, unless theparameter is set to NO for a subordinate Document Class or Title.)</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>require release</td><td>0;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter determines whether the person entering the document isrequired (and prompted) to release the document from a draft state uponexit from the entry/editing process. Though designed for Discharge Summaries, release may be used for anykind of TIU document.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>require mas verification</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:YES, ALWAYS<br/>0:NO<br/>2:UPLOAD ONLY<br/>3:DIRECT ENTRY ONLY<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter determines whether verification by MAS is required, priorto public access and signature of the document. Though designed for Discharge Summaries, verification may be used forany kind of TIU document, and is particularly helpful for documents thatare uploaded from a transcription service. Allowable values are:  0       NO                       1       YES, ALWAYS                       2       UPLOAD ONLY                       3       DIRECT ENTRY ONLY where 1 indicates that these documents require verification regardlessof how they originate; 2 indicates that verification is required only when the documents are Uploaded; and 3 indicates that verification is required only when documents are entered directly into VISTA.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>require author to sign</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates whether or not the author should sign the document before the expected cosigner (attending). If parameter is set to NO, only the expected cosigner is alerted for signature. Although the unsigned document appears in the author's unsigned list, and he is ALLOWED to sign it, his signature is not REQUIRED. If set to YES, then the author is alerted for signature, and if theexpected cosigner should attempt to sign the document first, he isinformed that the author has not yet signed.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>when may chart copy be printed</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8925_6.html">8925.6</a></td><td></td><td>OUT OF SERVICE.   Printing for a given status is governed by businessrules. Indicate the status which a document must attain before it can be printedfor the chart.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>routine print event(s)</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>R:release<br/>V:verification<br/>B:both<br/></td><td></td><td>A document of the given type, and of ROUTINE urgency, is automaticallyprinted whenever one of these events occurs. For example, a site may specify that ROUTINE documents print only uponCompletion (i.e., signature or cosignature), while STAT documents printupon Release from Transcription, MAS Verification, or both, in additionto printing upon completion. If print events are not specified, and a CHART COPY DEVICE is defined for the Medical Center Division, then the document will be auto-printedonly upon completion. If field MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY is set to YES, then auto-print isignored entirely. If urgency is not specified for some document, then its urgency isconsidered to be routine, and the document prints when a routine printevent occurs.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>stat print event(s)</td><td>0;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>R:release<br/>V:verification<br/>B:both<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is identical to ROUTINE PRINT EVENT(S), except that itapplies to documents of STAT urgency rather than ROUTINE urgency.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>manual print after entry</td><td>0;8</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter is used for documents where a manually-printed hard copyis desired following document entry. If the parameter is set to YES, theuser is prompted to print a copy on exit from their preferred editor,and auto-printing (as described in fields ROUTINE/STAT PRINT EVENT(S))is ignored.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>allow chart print outside mas</td><td>0;9</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field determines whether non-MAS users (for example, providers) areasked if they want WORK copies or CHART copies when they print adocument.  If the field is NOT set to YES, they are not asked, and theprintout is a WORK copy. Generally, this is set to YES for PROGRESS NOTES, which are likely to beprinted on the Ward or in the Clinic for immediate inclusion in thechart.  For DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, which are typically printed centrally,it is usually set to NO, since duplicate CHART COPIES are a particular problem.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>allow >1 records per visit</td><td>0;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field determines whether a given document may be created more thanonce per visit.  For example, it is often appropriate to enter multiplePROGRESS NOTES for a single HOSPITALIZATION or CLINIC VISIT, whereasonly one DISCHARGE SUMMARY is usually entered per HOSPITALIZATION.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>enable irt interface</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This enables TIU's interface with Incomplete Record Tracking (IRT),which updates IRT's deficiencies when transcription, signature,or cosignature events are registered for a given document. NOTE: IRT is designed for DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, and is appropriateonly for types of documents where only one document is expected per patient movement. We therefore ask you to leave this parameterundefined (or set it to NO) for PROGRESS NOTES.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>irt deficiency</td><td>0;12</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="393_3.html">393.3</a></td><td></td><td>This field provides a mapping between the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION and the corresponding IRT DEFICIENCY TYPE.  For example, TIU Class DISCHARGESUMMARY maps to IRT Deficiency Type DISCHARGE SUMMARY.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>default printer</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td></td><td>NOT IN SERVICE. When a user prints a document of the given type and is prompted forDEVICE, this serves as the default.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>suppress dx/cpt on entry</td><td>0;14</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter applies only to documents for outpatient care. Togetherwith parameter ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS, it determines whether ornot a user is prompted for diagnoses and procedures after signing or editing a document. If this parameter is set to YES (for suppress), the user is not prompted for this information.  If this parameter is set to NO or is blank, the user may or may notbe prompted, depending on the type of visit and on parameter ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS. If a site elects to suppress diagnoses and procedures, the site mustcapture this information by some other means (such as an AICS encounterform), in order to receive workload credit for these visits.</td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>force response to exposures</td><td>0;15</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>When set to YES, this parameter forces the user to respond when asked tospecify a veteran's Service Connection Classification (AO, IR, or EC),when creating a standalone visit.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>ask dx/cpt on all opt visits</td><td>0;16</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter applies only to documents for outpatient care, and isIGNORED if SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY is set to YES. If DX/CPT prompts are NOT suppressed, and ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITSis set to YES, the user is prompted for DX/CPT information for scheduled as well as unscheduled (stand-alone) visits. If DX/CPT prompts are NOT suppressed, and ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITSis set to NO, the user is prompted for DX/CPT information for unscheduled visits ONLY.</td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>send alerts on addenda</td><td>0;17</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter determines whether AUTHORS and COSIGNERS of a documentof this kind (and any of its descendent types) will receive an informational alert when addenda are added by other persons.The addendum must be in a COMPLETED or AMENDED status for an alert tobe generated.Like all document parameters, it may be overridden at descendent levels of the Document Definition Hierarchy. DEFAULT is NO.</td></tr><tr><td>.18</td><td>order id entries by title</td><td>0;18</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This prompt applies only to notes with interdisciplinary entries underthem. When an ID note is displayed or printed, the child entries are normallyordered by reference date under the parent entry. In some cases it may be preferable to order them alphabetically by title. If this parameter is set to YES, child entries are displayed by title rather than by date. The default order is by date.</td></tr><tr><td>.19</td><td>send alerts on new id entry</td><td>0;19</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter applies only to interdisciplinary parent notes. If this parameter is set to YES, the signer (cosigner) of aninterdisciplinary parent note is alerted when a new entry is added to the note. The default is NO.</td></tr><tr><td>.2</td><td>send cosignature alert</td><td>0;20</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:After Author has SIGNED<br/>1:Immediately<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter controls the sequence in which alerts are sent to theexpected cosigner of a document. Allowable choices are:</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>processing steps</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8925_951.html">8925.951</a></td><td></td><td>OUT OF SERVICE</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>division</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8925_952.html">8925.952</a></td><td></td><td>Parameters CHART COPY PRINTER and STAT CHART COPY PRINTER may beindependently defined according to Medical Center Division. Please indicate the Medical Center Division for which theseparameters are being defined.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>editor set-up code</td><td>3;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is M code which is executed prior to invoking the user's preferrededitor.  It ordinarily sets local variables, which are then used in theeditor's header, etc. For example, code written at Boston VAMC sets a local array containingpatient demographics.  An M-based editor used at the site can then display demographic information in a fixed header when a user edits a document.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>filing error alert recipients</td><td>4;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8925_954.html">8925.954</a></td><td></td><td>These persons receive alerts from the upload filer process when a document of the given type cannot be filed/located, or has a missing field. If a document being uploaded has a missing/bad title, then alertrecipients defined at the title level cannot be found.  In this case,recipients named at the class level are alerted. For example, if aProgress Note is being uploaded and has a missing/bad title, then Progress Note-level recipients are alerted. If recipients are not specified, then alert recipients named in parameter UPLOAD ERROR ALERT RECIPIENTS in the TIU PARAMETER file are alerted as defaults.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>users requiring cosignature</td><td>5;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8925_955.html">8925.955</a></td><td></td><td>Please indicate which groups of users (i.e., User Classes) requirecosignature for the type of document in question.  For example, STUDENTS, INTERNS, LPNs, and other user classes may be identified as requiring a cosignature for PROGRESS NOTES. NOTE: Users specified as requiring a cosignature for DISCHARGE SUMMARY documents cannot be selected as Attending Physicians for thesedocuments. This ensures that users who require a cosignaturecannot cosign these documents.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>heading</td><td>6;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>footer</td><td>7;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>closing</td><td>8;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9.01</td><td>justify heading</td><td>9;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>LJ:LEFT JUSTIFIED<br/>CJ:CENTER JUSTIFIED<br/>RJ:RIGHT JUSTIFIED<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9.02</td><td>justify footer</td><td>9;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>LJ:LEFT JUSTIFY<br/>CJ:CENTER JUSTIFY<br/>RJ:RIGHT JUSTIFY<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9.03</td><td>justify closing</td><td>9;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>LJ:LEFT JUSTIFY<br/>CJ:CENTER JUSTIFY<br/>RJ:RIGHT JUSTIFY<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9.04</td><td>page numbers</td><td>9;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9.05</td><td>justify page numbers</td><td>9;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>LJ:LEFT JUSTIFIED<br/>CJ:CENTER JUSTIFIED<br/>RJ:RIGHT JUSTIFIED<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9.06</td><td>insert blank lines</td><td>9;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
