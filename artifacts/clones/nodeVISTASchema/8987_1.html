For example, if you enter a "3", thenroutine commands and routine global accesses will be grouped together bythe first 3 characters of their name.</td></tr><tr><td>5.1</td><td>dflt gbl name length(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>       This is a required field that is used by the Global Report so thatglobal accesses can be grouped.

Therefore, the numberof commands they execute are relativity very small for a RTHIST session.A "bucket" called '<thresh' in the Routine command report is where allcommand counts for these types of routine(s) will be collected.  Forexample, if routine ABC executes 976 commands for a RTHIST session and youspecify 1000 as the thresh hold value, then ABC's command count will beplaced in the '<thresh' bucket.</td></tr><tr><td>5.3</td><td><thresh gbl grefs/sec(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>       Some DHCP routines reference global(s) very little.  Therefore, thenumber of global references are relativity very small for a RTHISTsession.  A "bucket" called '<thresh' in the Global Access report is whereall these type of global(s) will get placed.  For example, if global ABCis referenced 109 times fora RTHIST session and you specify 300 as thethresh hold, the ABC's reference count will be placed in the '<thresh'bucket.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>local cmp recipients</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8987_16.html">8987.16</a></td><td></td><td> This field contains the local recipients of MPM alerts or informationalmessages from the performance monitor.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>remote cmp recipients</td><td>4;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8987_17.html">8987.17</a></td><td></td><td>These recipients will receive MSM PERFORMANCE DATA. They could be remotemail groups or server names specified by your ISC. Data from ALL siteswill always be sent to G.CMP@ISC-SF.DOMAIN.EXT and does not need to be addedhere (this is the Capacity Management Directorate). Other ISC's who wish to collect performance data from one or more sitesshould first create a similar mail group. To this group, add appropriaterecipients, as well as the server option S.A6ALOAD2. This option shouldlook like the following: NAME: A6ALOAD2                          MENU TEXT: File MSM Data FromSites  TYPE: server                          CREATOR: CLEMENS,JOHN  ROUTINE: A6ALOAD2                     SERVER BULLETIN: (your choice)  SERVER ACTION: RUN IMMEDIATELY        SERVER MAIL GROUP:  SERVER AUDIT: YES                     SERVER REPLY: SEND REPLY IN ALLCASES  UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: FILE MSM DATA FROM SITES  A6ALOAD2 is the routine which will file incoming data from sites into theMSM RTHIST REPORT DATA file at the ISC. The routine is available uponrequest from G.KERNEL DEVELOPER@ISC-SF.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
