While most medical centers only have one division, there are anumber that are multi-divisional.  As a result, it was necessary tostructure the entire system around the division concept. However, single division medical centers will not notice this in theeveryday execution of the module. Within a division there may be a number of physical locationswhere an imaging procedure can be performed.  The module is designed tohandle multiple locations within a division.  However, each location canonly be associated with one division.  Location data is stored in the'IMAGING LOCATIONS' file (#79.1). These parameters are loaded into the user's partition once the moduledetermines which division and location the user is currently associatedwith.  This is determined by one of two ways: 1) the device the user isusing is an entry in the 'INPUT DEVICES' sub-file of the 'IMAGINGLOCATIONS' file or 2) if (1) is not true than the module will simply askthe user what his/her current location is.  Method 1 is becoming obsolete;it was used before virtual terminals came into being.  Therefore, mostsystems will ask the user for a sign-on imaging location.  Entries in this file should not be deleted. Adding new entries is alwaysallowed.  Data Storage ------------The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED DIVISION' file is stored in the ^RA(79,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates ---------------The following is a list of input templates used by the packageand the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:                         Compiled Name                   Routine   Description; Option(s) ----                   -------   ---------------------- RA DIVISION PARAMETERS           Used to enter/edit division parameters                                  that the package coordinator controls;                                  RA SYSDIV If any modifications to these input templates are needed for localpurposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logicin the template.  Print Templates --------------- The following is a list of print templates used by the radiology package:  Name                  Description; Option(s) ----                  ---------------------- RA IMAGE DIV LIST     Prints the division parameters for the entries in                       this file;                       RA SYSDIVLIST  Sort Templates --------------The radiology package does not use any sort templates associated with thisfile.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>division(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name of this division.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>track exam status changes</td><td>.1;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:yes<br/>N:no<br/></td><td></td><td>This 'division' parameter can be set to 'Yes' to collect the date and thetime of exam status changes.

Until this field is set to YES thesystem will NOT use the Site Specific Accession Number during registration of a new case.  Only when all devices are able to handle the Site Specific Accession Number should this field be set to YES, at which point the system will use the Site Specific Accession Number.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>auto user code filing</td><td>.1;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:yes<br/>N:no<br/></td><td></td><td>This 'division' parameter can be set to indicate that the user should beasked for their access code during the processing of exams and reports of which various activity logs are kept.  If this parameter is set to 'Yes',then the system automatically uses the user code associated with theinitial logon.  If this parameter is set to 'No', then the system asks theaccess code during each process. </td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>detailed procedure required</td><td>.1;7</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:yes<br/>N:no<br/></td><td></td><td>This 'division' parameter can be set to 'Yes' if the entry of a'detailed', 'series' or 'parent' procedure type should be required duringthe initial exam registration or request. If this parameter is set to 'No', then the user can enter 'broad' proceduretype, but this must be changed to 'detailed' or 'series' before the examstatus can be changed to 'complete'.</td></tr><tr><td>.18</td><td>print jacket lbls w/each visit</td><td>.1;8</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:yes<br/>N:no<br/></td><td></td><td>This 'division' parameter can be set to 'Yes' to indicate that a jacketlabel should be printed automatically during each visit. If this field is set to YES and the field 'HOW MANY JACKET LABELS PERVISIT' in the IMAGING LOCATIONS (79.1) file is set to zero, then thedefault will become two (i.e., two jacket labels will print out).</td></tr><tr><td>.19</td><td>ask 'camera/equip/rm'</td><td>.1;9</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:yes<br/>N:no<br/></td><td></td><td>This 'division' parameter can be set to 'Yes' to indicate that the'camera/equip/rm' should be asked during exam editing.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>contrast reaction message</td><td>CON;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is an optional field that may contain a site-defined message to bedisplayed with the warning message for patients who have had a reactionto the contrast medium.
