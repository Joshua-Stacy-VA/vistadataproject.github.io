The extract Entries are read only and may be selected by number or extract name. The extract Summary entries are currently created from two types ofprocessing:1) Generic EXTRACT tool manual runs and automated runs2) LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN and LREPI NIGHTLY TASK on day 15 of each monthGeneric extract summary entries:The REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME is the combination of a unique abbreviation.When the extract is created from the EXTRACT manual and automated options, theREMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME will include Q, M, or Y (for quarterly, monthly,or yearly), nn for month or quarter, and yyyy for year. The following is anexample of extract names:     VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M2          VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M1         VA-IHD QUERI 2005 M12     National extract summary entries created from generic Reminder Extractfunctionality (not LREPI) are stored with a VA- prefixed name.  Each extractentry contains reminder compliance totals for each unique combination ofpatient list and reminder.  The extract will optionally store findingcompliance totals if the TYPE OF TOTALS for the extract is "Compliance andFinding Totals". No patient specific data is stored in the extract summaryfile for generic extracts.  The patient lists (denominators) used to createthe extract summary totals, for a particular reporting period, are availablefrom Reminder Patient List options.  Generic extract summary entries will default to be purged after 5 years.  Theautomated purge status can be changed for a particular extract summary entryto retain the entry indefinitely.  LREPI extract summary entries:The LREPI extract names use YY/MM representing the ending year andmonth of the extract date range, and the run date in the format YYMMDD. Thedate and time of the run is an identifier.  The following is an example ofLREPI extract names.    LREPI 00/05 061500         LREPI 00/06 073100         LREPI 00/07 081500   The LREPI extract entries assume all results are for the primary institution,and includes patient specific data with findings.  The LREPI extracts createdare based on LREPI reporting criteria which is not available for genericreporting functionality.    This file will maintain up to 36 extract entriesfor each type of extract.  After 36 entries, when a new entry is added, theoldest entry is deleted from the file.  Sites are asked to run the LREPIENHANCE MANUAL RUN for months starting from 10/01/98 through 8/31/00. This willseed the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) database with risk assessmentdata.  Subsequent updates to the EPI database will automatically occur monthlyvia the LREPI NIGHTLY TASK option. Sites will have up to 36 months of extracts.This may be fewer than 36 months if the site runs extracts for the same monthmore than once.  Multiple extracts for the same month occur when the site runsthe LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN for a month to fix errors found by the receivingnational database.  For LREPI runs, the receiving national database is theEmerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) at the Austin  Automation Center (AAC).   An LREPI entry in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file contains information that identifies the extract entry, the extract findings, and totals by finding item. The extract entry information includes the number, extract name, beginning andending extract dates, person who ran the extract option, task number, totalpatients evaluated and total patients with findings.  The extract findingsinclude a number (for ease of selecting a finding item), patient, reminderterm, value, alternate id, finding date, related visit (if PCE data), encountertype (I/O), result, value, drug and DSUP (days supply).  These extract findingfields are returned by the reminder evaluation logic.  The result, value, anddrug are all free text fields without specific input and output transformsbecause the data comes from the source VistA data it came from, with read onlyaccess on this file.  The alternate id is specific to the LREPI extracts.  Anumber value in the alternate id field indicates that the finding is forHepatitis C risk assessment.  The alternate id will be used for statisticalpurposes in the EPI database.      The flow of LREPI processing is as follows: 1) LREPI gathers Lab Search/Extractpatients and findings 2) LREPI gets all patients and findings from a reminderextract evaluation process given the extract date range and reminder list. (The reminder list is from a new LREPI file 69.51).  2.1) The reminder extractevaluation logic uses medications mapped to reminder terms in the VA-NATIONALEPI RX EXTRACT reminder, and the extract date range, to call new inpatientpharmacy and outpatient pharmacy extract logic to get patient pharmacyfindings.  2.2) The reminder extract evaluation uses the remaining remindercriteria to build a list of patients with findings from the following files inthe extract period:   LAB DATA           (#63)   V POV              (#9000010.07)   V HEALTH FACTORS   (#9000010.23)   V PATIENT ED       (#9000010.16)   V EXAM             (#9000010.13) 2.3) The list of patients is used to evaluate the VA-HEP C RISK ASSESSMENT andVA-NATIONAL EPI LAB EXTRACT reminders.  The findings within the extract daterange are added as Extract Findings in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file andthen returned to the Lab Search/Extract process.  3) The Lab Search/Extractprocess uses the final list of patients and findings to create HL7 messages. Each reminder finding for a patient is used to create a DSP segment.  Pharmacyfindings contain both a DSP and ZXE segment.  4) When the AAC processes themessages, error messages are returned for each message with the SSN related tothe erroneous data. Note: Messages with errors are not added to the EPIdatabase.  When erroneous data is  fixed at the site, the LREPI ENHANCE MANUALRUN is run for the month with the error to transmit the entire month's dataagain.  The new data for each patient and finding date  replaces the oldpatient and finding date's data.  5) Two new options are available on theREMINDER REPORTS menu that provide total counts by finding item, as well as adetailed list by finding item and SSN.  6) Sites are encouraged to provideFileMan read-only access to the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (810.3) for thosewho validate the extract data, the Hepatitis C implementation team, andHepatitis C Coordinators responsible for monitoring Hepatitis C activities ateach site.  </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the extract summary number.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The NAME is the combination of a unique abbreviations for the type of extract.The file contains different extract types:                                  1) EPI - Hep C Extract                                  Extracts of this type are prefixed LREPI. The following is an example of EPIlookup information:                                  LREPI 00/05 061500LREPI 00/06 073100LREPI 00/07 081500                                      The YY/MM represents the ending year and month of the extract date range, andthe run date in the format YYMMDD.
