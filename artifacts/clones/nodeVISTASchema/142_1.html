Setting DISABLE FLAG to T(emporary) causesa component to be non-selectable for use, but its OUT OF ORDER MESSAGEwill appear in any Health Summary in which it is included. Use the at-sign (@) at the DISABLE FLAG: permanent (or temporary)// prompt,to enable the component for use.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>lock</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>To be used for components such as psychology test resultsRestricts viewing access under Print Health Summary Menu</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>selection file</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="142_17.html">142.17</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name or number of the file from which selection items (e.g., labtests (file 60), radiology procedures (file 71), vital signs (file120.51), PCE reminder/maintenance item (file 811.9) may be chosen for thiscomponent. The file you identify here must have its "Application Group"multiple include "GMTS" BEFORE it can be selected as a selection file. Components which require selection of items should have its componentname include the word "SELECTED".</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>out of order message</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used when a health summary component is temporarily disabled.If it is filled in, the message here will be displayed whenever the userattempts to select the component</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>default header name</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The DEFAULT HEADER NAME will appear in menus and component headers inpreference to the COMPONENT NAME, but NOT in preference to the localHEADER NAME, if it is defined for that component within a given Health Summary Type.
