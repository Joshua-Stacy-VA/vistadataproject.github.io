Each record holds an expansion of the abbreviation which is usedto complete the sig as it is printed on the Rx label.  Care should be takento not delete entries in this file after going into production use of thepharmacy package.  If an entry were deleted then any sigs that containthe abbreviation would not find it when printed later and thus could confusethe patient. The above description indicates that this file is not strictly 'pointed to'in the classical FileManager sense, but that logically it is nearly thesame thing.                           *** NOTE ***This file is ALWAYS overwritten at install of a new package and entriesthat are added at the site will disappear, also Synonyms added by the site will do the same.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>For inpatient pharmacy use, you may enter one of the following standardtimes or you may use a non-standard schedule when appropriate.
