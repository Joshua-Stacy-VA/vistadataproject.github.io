The strength components are simply parsed data from the drug strength description, placed into static numerically aligned and alphabetic fields.  There is no additional information about the strength description contained in the STRENGTHTBL than what is in the drug strength description.The Internal entry number (D0) is the SKEY_STR described below:The smart key strength code is a four digit number (with leading zeros removed) identifying all unique strength descriptions.  The unique feature of the SKEY_STR field is that a unique SKEY_STR value identifies the same strength regardless of any other SKEY component.  This means a SKEY_STR value of 15, identifying 0.05mg, is the same for all SKEYS.  SKEY_STR values are assigned onthe basis of strength units, and this group assignment allows for an assignmentof SKEY_STR values as relative numbers.  For instance, the range of SKEY_STR values, 1 through 999 represent milligrams, so a value of 5 is less than 500, the 5 being 0.02mg, and the 550 being 130 mg.  Percents are assigned relative numbers in the range 1000 through 2000, so a SKEY_STR value of 1000 is less than a SKEY_STR value of 1100.  A value of 150 compared to 1000 would have no meaning, since we would be comparing a milligram to a percent.  This relative ranking of numbers means that a selection of all strengths between 15mg and 100mg is possible by simply specifying the SKEY_STR range of 270-475 (270 is 15mg, and 475 is 100mg).If a SKEY_STR for an NDC is assigned zero, CHCS will assign it a valuestarting with 10000.  All NDCs using the same 10 character strength description will point to the same value.  As First DataBank assigns a SKEY_STR to that strength description CHCS will change SKEY_STR to reflect theassignment.  The range and meaning of First DataBanks SKEY_STR is as follows:    1 -  999 Mg 1000 - 2000 Percent 3000 - 3205 UnitsDescription of the FDB Smart Key.  The Smart Key is a 24 numeric digit field assigned to each NDC as follows:Col   Col         Description         MNEMONIC    # of digits 1  -  2  Generic Therapeutic Class   SKEY_GTC           2 3 -   6  Specific Therapeutic Class  SKEY_STC           4 7 -  11  Generic Name                SKEY_HICL          512 -  15 *Drug Strength               SKEY_STR           416 -  18  Dosage Form                 SKEY_DOSE          319 -  20  Route of Administration     SKEY_RT            221 -  23  Package Size                SKEY_PS            324 -  24  Unit Dose - Unit of Use     SKEY_UDUU          1          (0=Neither,1=Unit Dose            2=Unit of Use)</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>str(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>An alphanumeric description of drug potency in units of grams, milligrams, percentage, etc. In specific instances, strength may be described in mg. per n ml, where n is greater than one, to correspond to the manufacturer's description.

This field is also used for additional descriptors such as needle sizes, length of devices, etc.Drug Strength Description (STR) displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.The 10 character Description is the fourth space delimited parameter to display.

These fields are recommended for users who require precision in the strength field for the purposes of dosage calculations and other applications. For those users who need only the conventional strength descriptive information, the Drug Strength Description (STR) is suggested.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>strun</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The strength of a drug product in NDDF* is usually expressed in the metric system.
