Data in thisfield is the actual LOINC code value determined for this test. The data isthe same as the .01 field of the LOINC Codes file (file #8199). Note thisfield is NOT a pointer field. This is to allow test results and LOINC codesto be assigned that may not be in the LOINC codes file. A LOINC code whichis not in CHCS may be captured from an off-board system via an HL-7 messagewhen the off-board system is using a different version of the LOINC tables. Data in this field should not be modified by the user and is generallyhidden from most data entry mechanisms.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>result type(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>I:INTERMEDIATE<br/>F:FINAL<br/>#I:INTERMEDIATE REPORT-PRIORITY<br/>#F:FINAL REPORT-PRIORITY<br/>/A:AMENDED FINAL REPORT<br/></td><td></td><td>This field contains a set of internally stored codes forindicating whether the results are INTERMEDIATE or FINAL.Intermediate results can be certified.
