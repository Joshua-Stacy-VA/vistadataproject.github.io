Thecontrol node for this number will be ^PSN(54.4,"*","ID"), a noncompatible node with Fileman.  The node will store the last numberused, and will be incremented, within each day, by one.The format of the sequence number will be a 7 digit Fileman dateconcatenated with a sequential 5 digit number, starting at 00001for each day.Examples: 295070100001, 225070100002, 295070100003, 295070200001, etc. The purpose of the sequence number is to identify the exact orderin which transactions, in this file, are completed.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>LOG NUMBER(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This field indicates the internal number that the system assigns to thetransaction.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DATE TRANSACTION COMPLETED</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td>AD</td><td>This field indicates the date that the transaction was completed.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>TRANSACTION LOGGED BY</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td/><td>This field indicates the user who carried out the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>CONTROLLED ITEM(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="54_2.html">54.2</a></td><td>AC</td><td>This field indicates the controlled substance involved in the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>QUANTITY OF THIS TRANSACTION(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This is the quantity that was used to either decrement or incrementthe quantity on hand in the Inventory Record File when this transactionwas completed.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>REMARKS</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This free text field contains user comments regarding modification of thetransaction.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>COMMENTS(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This free text field contains user comments regarding the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>VAULT DISPENSED FROM(+)</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="59.html">59</a></td><td/><td>This field indicates the vault from which the controlled substance wasdispensed.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>DATE TRANSACTION STARTED(+)</td><td>0;11</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td/><td>This field indicates the date when the user began entering the transaction inthe system.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>REFERENCE NUMBER(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>ARFN</td><td>This field is a variable pointer type field.  It is set through hard codeto reference entries in other files that have generated a transaction logentry.  The first $P("-") reflects the type entry in the other files, eg.RX=Prescription file (52), IS=Issue file (54.3), AD=Adjustment which pointsback to this file and ST=Supply transaction (54.5).  The second $P("-") isthe .01 or name field in the other file.  The .01 field was usedbecause fileman would not support variable pointers and there was not reallya need to have a hard relation between this file and the others as this fileis an audit log type file only and is used to record an audit trail of transactions in other files only.The 'CRFN' x-ref will only show up on prescription that have been triggeredby the entry of a new, renew, or refill prescription action and will bekilled out when the quantity field (DD(54.4,4,0)) is filled in.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>INVENTORY AFTER TRANSACTION(+)</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This field should reflect the existing Controlled item inventory onhand after this transaction is complete.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>TRANSACTION CODE(+)</td><td>1;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="54_41.html">54.41</a></td><td/><td>This field, which points to the TRANSACTION TYPE file (#54.41), indicates thecode associated with the transaction type.
