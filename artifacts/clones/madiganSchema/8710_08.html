The order will be generated for the sample already in the lab.The process of producing the order, though, is very automatic.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>boolean expression(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is an expression the system will use to determine if the resultentered warrants ordering a secondary test to verify an abnormal result. This order can be placed automatically by filling in the AUTOMATIC ORDERfield, otherwise, the Lab Tech will be prompted and given the choice whetheror not to order it.  The expression can optionally contain an "LRX" at thebeginning. Followed by one of the following <, >, = or [ (contains). Examples are:     Result           Secondary Test     Boolean Expression   ------           --------------     ------------------   Glu >500         Acetone            LRX>500 or >500   Glu <50          Insulin            LRX<50  or <50   RPR =R           VDRL               LRX="R" or ="R"   Bilirubin =P     Ictotest           LRX["P" or ["P"    * Be careful when using the "[" (contains) sign.     This cannot be used in the case of RPR to ["R".  It will      also pick 'NR' and 'WR' because they contain a 'R'.   * When using the = or [ followed by a letter (ie., P for Pos     or N for Neg) the letter must be in " " (quotes).</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>requesting hcp</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="6.html">6</a></td><td></td><td>The lab user must first enter a lab-specific provider into the providerfile.  This provider could have a name like "Lab, Generated" and aprovider class of 'Outside Provider' so that the provider will never haveorders that need to be signed and the Patient Lab Inquiry will indicate thesource of the new orders.   Once the new provider is in the provider file, enter it here.  Thesystem will pull the name from this entry when the order is generated.If a provider is not entered in this field, the system uses the providerentered in the original order as the requesting HCP.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>requesting location</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44.html">44</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the requesting location of all laboratory-generated orders.  Thiswill probably be the Lab Section that normally does the test.  If thisentry is blank, the system uses the Requesting Location from theoriginal order.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>meprs code</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8119.html">8119</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the MEPRS code for the laboratory section.  If this entry is blank, thesystem uses the code from the original order.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>suppress report</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:SUPPRESSED<br/></td><td></td><td>If this test is requested by the lab user, but the lab does not want theresult displayed to users other than lab personnel, enter a "1" in thisfield.  The result will not appear on any copy of reports and will notdisplay during Patient Lab Inquiry for the HCPs.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>automatic order</td><td>0;7</td><td>12</td><td></td><td></td><td>Yes in this field will automatically place a secondary order if theBOOLEAN XP is "TRUE". Enter "YES" in this field if you want a secondary order to be automaticallyordered without prompting the user to place the order.  A "NO" or nullin this field will prompt the user to place the order if the BOOLEAN XP is"TRUE".</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>automatic accession</td><td>0;8</td><td>12</td><td></td><td></td><td>Yes in this field will automatically accession and log-in tests orderedthrough secondary orders. Enter "YES" in this field if you want the order to be automaticallyaccessioned.  For tests performed in the same accession area as theprimary test, the order will be added to the current accession number.For tests performed outside of the accession area in which the primary test is performed or the secondary test requires a unique accession,a new accession number will be generated. If the Collection Sample of the Secondary Test is different than theCollection Sample of the Primary Test, the order will not beaccessioned.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
