First DataBank will stop updating this NDC after a cutoffobsolete period agreed upon by the customer.  This cutoff obsolete period istypically 3 years, so that if, for example, an NDC contained an obsolete valueof 890101, January 1, 1989, then on any update or full file tape created on orafter January 1, 1992 (3 years after 890101), the NDC would no longer be sent. Customers need to know that the NDC is no longer being supported on theirupdate tapes, so that the customer system can either anticipate when the NDCwill no longer be sent, based on the cutoff date the customer provides to FirstDataBank, or by receiving a full file replacement formulary on some regularlyscheduled basis, or through ad hoc requests.  This field can be used in conjunction with the Previous National Drug Code(PNDC) and the Replacement National Drug Code (REPNDC).</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>DUPLICATE BRAND NAME</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>D:Duplicate<br/></td><td/><td>This field is a flag indicating whether an entry is a duplicate brand names. over-the-counter items such as Bayer Select may have multiple formulations butidentical brand names.</td></tr><tr><td>1.01</td><td>EXPANDED GNN</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This field contains the drug ingredient names adopted by the USAN.

This field will NOT use these abbreviations, sincethe generic name is more explicit and easier to read. </td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div>
