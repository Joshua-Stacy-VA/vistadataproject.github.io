This is to allow test results andLOINC codes to be assigned that may not be in the LOINC codes file. A LOINCcode which is not in CHCS may be captured from an off-board system via anHL-7 message when the off-board system is using a different version of theLOINC tables.                 Data in this field should not be modified by the user and is generally hiddenfrom most data entry mechanisms. </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>result type(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>I:INTERMEDIATE<br/>F:FINAL<br/>#I:INTERMEDIATE REPORT-PRIORITY<br/>#F:FINAL REPORT-PRIORITY<br/>/A:AMENDED FINAL REPORT<br/></td><td/><td>This field contains a set of internally stored codesfor indicating whether the results are INTERMEDIATE,FINAL, or AMENDED.
