You can enter multiple divisionsinto this file.This file defines division specific parameters for the laboratory</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>delta check (days back)</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field specifies how far back (in number of days) the systemwill look for previous patient results to be compared withcurrent results for delta checks.  (Delta checks are defined in theDELTA CHECK file -#62.1 and entered in the LAB TEST file -#60 underthe site/specimen field.)  This time period holds for all delta checkson all tests in the system.  It is more system intensive, howeverto have a greater time period specified for a small number of testsrather than a short period of time defined for a large number of tests.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>qc warning</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the number that will be multiplied against onestandard deviation from the mean to determine the high and low limits ofa QC result.  If the lab test result differs from its predefined meanby more than one standard deviateion multiplied by this number, then the system will generate a warning.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>qc alert</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the number that will be multiplied against one standard deviation from the mean to determine the exceptionally (panic)high and exceptionally (panic) low limits of a QC result.  If the lab test result differs from its predefined mean by more than onestandard deviation multiplied by this number, then the systemwill generate a warning and ask the user for a confirmation of theresult.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>teaching facility</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field specifies whether this division is a teaching facility.  If this field is set to yes, then during anatomic pathology result entry,the transcriptionist will be prompted to enter the name of the resident pathologist.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>non-human specimen count</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is not edited by the user.

It identifies the generic requesting location used for lab mail-inorders from referral locations. It is important that each division has a remote location entry in the Hospital Location File, and that the entry is namespaced by division (ie. ZZZ Division would have a namespaced entry in the Hospital Location File of Z REMOTE LAB).</td></tr><tr><td>1.01</td><td>collection list copies</td><td>1;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Specify the number of copies of collection lists to print via the PrintCollection List option.

This field contains the name of the device that the collection list will printwhen the Auto Generate Collection List/Labels (LAG) option is selected.A collection list will be generated for each collection round at the time the round is scheduled to begin.</td></tr><tr><td>1.04</td><td>print order id</td><td>1;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter yes in this field if you want the order numbers to print on thecollection list.  The collection list format is more compactif the order numbers do not print.</td></tr><tr><td>1.05</td><td>collection label printer</td><td>1;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>In put must be a valid device name from the Device file.  Thisfield contains the name of the device that collection labels willprint when the Auto Generate Collection List/Labels (LAG) option isselected.</td></tr><tr><td>1.06</td><td>non-routine lab collect allowd</td><td>1;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter "NO" if you do not want any lab collect order with a collectionpriority higher than routine.  These lab collect orders will appearon the collection list. Enter "YES" if you allow the lab collect order to have a higher collectionpriority (STAT) than routine.  The lab collect orders that have a highercollection priority than routine will print on NON-ROUTINE LAB COLLECTDEVICE defined in another file.  Then the lab can respond to them inthe a timely manner.</td></tr><tr><td>1.07</td><td>non-routine lab collect device</td><td>1;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of the device on which all NON-ROUTINE lab collect order will print.

If no number is entered in this fieldthe system will default to 25. Each day the inpatient cumulative reprints with new results to replacethe inpatient cumulative from the previous day.  Rather than reprintlarge copies of the cumulative for critical patients the system createsa split when a certain number of ordered tests is reached.  </td></tr><tr><td>4.06</td><td>cumulative print order</td><td>4;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>I:INVERTED DATE<br/></td><td></td><td>THIS FIELD IS NOT CURRENTLY USED BY CHCS. Specify in this field if the result should appear in chronilogicalorder with the oldest result following the previous results.
