This is used to convert site files that are usingthe deleted NDC to the replacement NDC.  It is also used to redirect an allergyselection entry (8254.01) to a new Allergy Definition when applicable.Its IEN is the deleted NDC number with leading zero and all dashes removed.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td/><td>11</td><td/><td/><td>Number is the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for an obsolte NDC. This IEN is the National Drug Code (NDC) with dashes and leading zeros removed.The NDC Number displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.  This primary IDdisplays its numeric value prepended with zeros to make it an eleven digitnumber with dashes added between the the fifth and sixth digit and ninth andtenth digit.  The NDC is the first space delimited parameter to display.  The NDC ID is formatted as NNNNN-NNNN-NN GNN (BN) STR RT GCDF.added to display as nnnnn-nnnn-nn.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>bn</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>BN</td><td>This field contains the brand name.  The brand name is usually the drug nameappearing on the package label and frequently is a trademark.  If necessary, itis edited to fit space requirements.  For non-brand generic products, thedescription is usually the generic name.This field is used as the descriptive product name in the "Blue Book" and"Price Alert" publications.Those users requiring a complete description of the drug product should alsouse the Additional Descriptor (AD) field.The brand name displays as part of the identifier of an NDC.  This 30-characterdescription displays only if it is different than the generic name.  When itdisplays it is the third space-delimited parameter surrounded by parentheses. The NDC ID is formatted as NNNNN-NNNN-NN GNN (BN) STR RT GCDF.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>gcnseqno(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8251.html">8251</a></td><td/><td>This field contains the GCN sequence number.  The GCN sequence number is arandom number representing the generic formulation.  It is specific to thegeneric ingredient combination, route of administration, dosage form, and drugstrength.  In addition, the GCN*SEQNO is the same across manufacturers andpackage sizes.  However, the GCN*SEQNO is an absolutely unique number; itcannot be duplicated. The number by itself has no significance.  No digit or group of digits withinthe GCN*SEQNO has any more significance than the rest of the number.  However,it is very useful when used for on-line computer applications, such as genericsubstitution.  The GCN*SEQNO can be used to group pharmaceutically equivalentproducts together.  (Note:  Products having the same GCN*SEQNO are notnecessarily bioequivalent.)</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>obsdte</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td/><td>This field contains the date that this National Drug Code (NDC) has beenidentified by the manufacturer as an obsolete (discontinued) NDC number.  When an NDC has been discontinued, First DataBank assigns an obsolete date tothe NDC record.  First DataBank will stop updating this NDC after a cutoffobsolete period agreed upon by the customer.  This cutoff obsolete period istypically 3 years, so that if, for example, an NDC contained an obsolete valueof 890101, January 1, 1989, then on any update or full file tape created on orafter January 1, 1992 (3 years after 890101), the NDC would no longer be sent. Customers need to know that the NDC is no longer being supported on theirupdate tapes, so that the customer system can either anticipate when the NDCwill no longer be sent, based on the cutoff date the customer provides to FirstDataBank, or by receiving a full file replacement formulary on some regularlyscheduled basis, or through ad hoc requests.  This field can be used inconjunction with the Previous National Drug Code (PNDC) and the ReplacementNational Drug Code (REPNDC).  </td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>repndc</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8254_03.html">8254.03</a></td><td/><td>This field contains the new National Drug Code that has replaced the NDC forthis product.
