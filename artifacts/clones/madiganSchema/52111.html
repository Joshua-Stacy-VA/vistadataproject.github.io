Newencounter records entered via CHCS are appended here.  User-selectedencounter records from this file can be written back to the MARC.  All MARCdata is kept in this file.  When data is written to the MARC, it is collectedfrom this file.  The Dental and Immunization modules are written and editedon this file and can be written to the MARC from this file.  This fileutilizes a subset of the ICD-9 file (#52122).  This file also points to thePharmacy Drug File PSAFDB NDCTBL (#8252).The first line of the Technical Description for each field is used bythe MARC write software to determine the field length for that field.I.E. Gender should only use 1 character (the code), not the expandedtext.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>patient(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a
