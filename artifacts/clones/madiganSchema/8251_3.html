An SKEY_RT code value is interpretedthe same for all SKEY subfields.  The SKEY_RT  is compatible with NDDF* one character (GCRT) and two character route (GCRT2), forming a one to onerelationship with each.  The compatibility provides both downward and upwardcompatibility with existing NDDF* data.  The SKEY_RT  allows the selection ofroute specific products with or without other SKEY subfield definitions, providing easy searches and easy formulary definitions.If a SKEY_RT for an NDC is assigned zero, CHCS will assign it a numeric value by concatenating each ascii character of the GCRT field as its Numeric equivalent $A().  All NDCs using the same 2 character route description will point to the same value.  As First DataBank assigns a SKEY_RT to that routedescription CHCS will change SKEY_RT to reflect the assignment. *NDDF is a Trade Mark of the Hearst Corporation.Description of the FDB Smart Key.  The Smart Key is a 24 numeric digit field assigned to each NDC as follows:Col   Col         Description         MNEMONIC    # of digits 1  -  2  Generic Therapeutic Class   SKEY_GTC           2 3 -   6  Specific Therapeutic Class  SKEY_STC           4 7 -  11  Generic Name                SKEY_HICL          512 -  15  Drug Strength               SKEY_STR           416 -  18  Dosage Form                 SKEY_DOSE          319 -  20 *Route of Administration     SKEY_RT            221 -  23  Package Size                SKEY_PS            324 -  24  Unit Dose - Unit of Use     SKEY_UDUU          1          (0=Neither,1=Unit Dose            2=Unit of Use)</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>GCRT(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>The 1-byte Route of Administration Code (GCRT) is an alternate form of theroute description.Route of Administration Code (RT) displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.The 10 character Description found is the fifth space delimited parameter todisplay.

However, the indicator is a First DataBank suggestion. * Systemic routes include any route commonly used to achieve appreciable bloodlevels.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div>
