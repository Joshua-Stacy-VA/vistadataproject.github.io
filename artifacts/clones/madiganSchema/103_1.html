An active order isone which is currently being processed.

A FULLY ACTIVEorder means that there are no conditions placed on the order's activity.SIGNATURE ABSENT means that the HCP and/or COUNTERSIGNING HCP have notyet signed the order, although the order is active because a nursehas signed it.

If RESULTED,the order has had all tasks resulted. EXPLICITLY DISCONTINUED meansthat an action was taken by a provider to stop this order. TRANSFERREDis the inactive status created when a patient is transferred withinthe MTF. At that point, all orders are 'discontinued' but the providerhas an opportunity to later mark which of these orders he would liketo 'reactivate'. This reactivation actually results in new orders being generated. SIGNATURE MISSING means that an order has beendiscontinued but still needs a signature or countersignature. Itwill continue to show up on the display screen until signed. If aprovider cancels an order requiring a signature, and he is qualifiedto sign that order, the signing takes place automatically and thisstatus is avoided.</td></tr><tr><td>2.04</td><td>PENDING SIGNATURE</td><td>2;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING SIGNATURE<br/></td><td/><td>This pending flag indicates that an order has not been activated because either a nurse or HCP signature has not yet been obtained.</td></tr><tr><td>2.05</td><td>PENDING APPOINTMENT</td><td>2;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PENDING APPOINTMENT<br/></td><td/><td>This pending flag indicates that an order is suspended while awaitingcompletion of the scheduling process.
