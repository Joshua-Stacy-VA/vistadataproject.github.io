Names should be entered in the format XXX, XXXX (forexample, MRI, HEAD).  A space should be entered after the comma for easylook-up.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>code(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>D</td><td>Enter an aphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric code that can be used toidentify this radiology procedure.  Be sure that codes are consistent forall procedures.  Codes can be obtained from the RVS tables.  Do not enteran American College of Radiologists (ACR) or Current Procedure Terminology(CPT) code.  Procedure codes are used for Medical Expense and PerformanceReports (MEPRS).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>type(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>R:RADIOLOGY PROCEDURE<br/>C:CHARGE<br/>G:PROCEDURE GROUP<br/></td><td></td><td>This field assigns the procedure to one of three possible categories: radiology procedure, procedure group, or charge.  Set this field to RADIOLOGY PROCEDURE if this is a single radiologydiagnostic procedure.  Set this field to PROCEDURE GROUP if this "procedure" is actually a groupof procedures or charges that may be ordered as a single entity.  Theworkload characteristics for a GROUP is based on the attributes of themembers of the group.  Ordering, scheduling, arriving, and departingattributes must be defined for a procedure group.  Set this field to CHARGE if this is a fee for a service or supply.  Chargesare not orderable, but may be associated with a primary radiologyprocedure.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>imaging type</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="79_2.html">79.2</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of the modality used to achieve an image (for example,RADIOLOGY or ULTRASOUND).  This field points to the .01 field of the Imaging Type file (#79.2). Imaging types must be entered in the Imaging Type file before they can beaccessed by this field.  Contact the Radiology Supervisor if additionalimaging types need to be entered into the data base.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>cost of procedure</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the local cost of this procedure or charge.  You may enter a costfrom 0 to 9999.99.  The data in this field does not appear on any CHCS-generated reports.  The CHCS automatically enters the cost into the SITECOST field (8151.02,5) in the Current Procedures Terminology file when youenter it here.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>days to check for duplicates</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter a number to define how many days before and after each performance ofthis procedure that you want the CHCS to check the Radiology Exam file forduplicate orders.  For example, if the number 3 were entered in this field, then the CHCSwould check for duplicate orders three days before the new performancedate, on the new performance date, and three days after the new performancedate, for a total of 7 days.  If this field is left blank, but the DUPLICATE CHECK field for thisprocedure is set to YES, then the CHCS defaults to the number entered inthe DAYS TO CHECK FOR DUPLICATES field in the Imaging Overall Parametersfile.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>total weight</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the RVS weighted workload value associated with this procedure.  Enter a value in this field only if this procedure does not have a dividedworkload value (that is, a procedure weight and a reporting weight).  Forprocedures with a divided workload value, the CHCS adds the values enteredin the PROCEDURE WEIGHT and REPORTING WEIGHT fields and automaticallyenters the sum in this field.  If no value is entered in the PROCEDURE WEIGHT and the REPORTING WEIGHTfields, then a value must be entered in this field.  The CHCS assignsworkload for this procedure when the exam reaches a status of COMPLETE.  If you are changing this procedure from a divided workload value into asingle workload value, then you must delete the values in both thePROCEDURE WEIGHT and REPORTING WEIGHT fields before you enter a value inthis field.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>procedure weight</td><td>0;13</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the RVS weighted workload value associated with performing theprocedure portion of this radiology procedure.  Enter a value in this field only if this procedure has a divided workloadvalue (that is, a procedure weight and a reporting weight).  If you enter a value in this field, then you must also enter a value in theREPORTING WEIGHT field.  The CHCS adds the value in this field to the valuein the REPORTING WEIGHT field and automatically entered in the TOTAL WEIGHTfield when the exam reaches a status of PRELIMINARY or COMPLETE.  If you do not enter a value in this field, then you must not enter a valuein the REPORTING WEIGHT field, but you must enter a value in the T0TALWEIGHT field.  If you are changing this procedure from a single workload value into adivided workload value, then you must delete the values in both this fieldand the REPORTING WEIGHT field before you enter the single workload valuein the TOTAL WEIGHT field.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>reporting weight</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the RVS weighted workload value associated with the radiologist'sreview of this procedure.  Enter a value in this field only if this procedure has a divided workloadvalue (that is, a procedure weight and a reporting weight).  If you enter a value in this field, then you must also enter a value thePROCEDURE WEIGHT field.  The value in this field is added to the value inthe PROCEDURE WEIGHT field and automatically entered in the TOTAL WEIGHTfield when the exam reaches a status of PRELIMINARY or COMPLETE.  The CHCSassigns workload for this procedure when the exam reaches a status ofCOMPLETE.  If you do not enter a value in this field, then you must not enter a valuein the PROCEDURE WEIGHT field, but you must enter a value in the TOTALWEIGHT field.  If you are changing this procedure from a single workload value into adivided workload value, then you must delete the values in both this fieldand the PROCEDURE WEIGHT field before you enter the single workload valuein the TOTAL WEIGHT field.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>duplicate check</td><td>0;15</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter YES if you want the CHCS to check for duplicate orders for thisprocedure.

If you set this field to ALL, then the system will notdisplay this procedure or group on any picklists, thereby making itunorderable.  For charge type procedures, the system defaults to ALL and doesnot allow you to edit this field. Enter a NO or leave this field blank if you do not want to suppress thisprocedure or procedure group from view.  If you set this field to NO, thenthe system will display this procedure or group on picklists, thereby makingit orderable by the appropriate users. Enter CLN if you want this procedure or procedure group to be suppressed fromview for clinical users.  If you set this field to CLN, then clinical userswill not be able to order this procedure or group.  Radiology users willstill be able to see and to order this procedure or group.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>procedures in group</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="71_12.html">71.12</a></td><td></td><td>This field is a multiple that contains the names of the radiologyprocedures and charges assigned to a procedure group.</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>films needed</td><td>F;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="71_02.html">71.02</a></td><td></td><td>This field is a multiple that identifies the film size(s) normally used forthis procedure.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>inactivation date</td><td>I;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the date after which this procedure will no longer be active.

After the appointment is made by the radiology staff, thedate and time is noted on the Patient Order List.  NOTE:  If you set this field to YES, then you should enter a time in theAVERAGE DURATION field.</td></tr><tr><td>8600.04</td><td>number of exposures</td><td>8600;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the number of exposures normally made for this procedure.  You maywish to enter data in this field only for frequently ordered procedures(for example, CXR).  The number entered in this field appears on the film utilization portion ofthe Patient Quality Assurance Report as well as on several workloadreports.  For some procedures, such as angiography, it may not be practicalto enter any data in this field.
