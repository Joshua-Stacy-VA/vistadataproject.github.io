When processing results,the rules are evaluated for a TRUE/FALSE condition. For each conditionthat is TRUE, one or more ACTIONS can be performed. Those actions thatare available are defined in this file. Creating new entries in this filerequires programmer assistance and the data in this file should neverbe manipulated by a site, as irreparable damage may cause the actionto be create unnecessary system error or other adverse issues.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>action name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This field will be the name of an action the user can tell the systemto perform whenever the associated rule's IF CONDITION is true,In rules processing, multiple actions can be specified to occur as partof the THEN PART of the rule.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>external representation</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This field defines how the action will appear within the rule.
