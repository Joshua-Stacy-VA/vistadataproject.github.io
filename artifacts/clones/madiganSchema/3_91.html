If this is a device, the status is "Awaiting Device"until the device has printed the message.  If this is a server, thestatus will be "Awaiting Server" until the server has read the message.In either of the above cases, the status becomes "done" when the processis complete, and "Last read" field describes when the process was complete. If the recipient is a remote user, the status is "awaiting transmission"and the Path field names the queue in which the message is waiting.  Whenthe message has been sent, the Transmission date is set, the remote messageID is set to the other domain's message number (providing bi-directionallinkage of messages), and the Path field is cleared.</td></tr><tr><td>6.1</td><td>path</td><td>6.1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>For Network MailMan, this field holds the first 250 characters of therecipient's forward path which indicates where the message should be sent.</td></tr><tr><td>6.2</td><td>path cont</td><td>6.2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>For Network Mailman, if the forward path for this recipient is greaterthan 250 characters, the characters greater than 250 are stored here.The first 250 characters are stored in PATH (field #6.1).</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>forward path?</td><td>0;7</td><td>12</td><td/><td>For Network MailMan, this code indicates whether or not the PATH field ispopulated. If the PATH field is not populated, then the whole forward pathis contained in the RECIPIENT field (3.91,.01) and there is no need toreference the PATH field.  For technical purposes, referencing this (local) code is more efficient than performing a disk hit for the check.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>elapsed time</td><td>0;8</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>For Network MailMan, this time indicates the number of seconds it takes tosend a network message.
