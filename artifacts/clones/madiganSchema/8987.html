Thesedefinitions are segregated into OS specific versions.  They areprepositioned for accepting input from the Option/Audit Global (and aStorage Global used only at the Software Modeling and Algorithyms Group). The operating system type is used to seggregate the reports for thespecific system information.  This set of definitions are input to the XUSODRV* routines as invokedfrom the EN^XUSODRV or RUN^XUSODRV.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>report identifier(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This is an implementation specific identifier for the identification ofthe report to be generated.  The routines which reference this table willbe identified as a field in this record.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>report header</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td/><td/><td>This is the header for the report.  The report identifier will appearin the upper left corner, the date will be centered, and the page numberwill occur in the upper right corner.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>field definitions</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="8987_02.html">8987.02</a></td><td/><td>This multiple describes each of the display fields that will beused to construct the report generation segments for the MUMPSimplementation and the report to be generated.  The variance fordifferent implementations are different groups of data extracted.Part of the field definition is extraction code.  The coordinatesof the field are recorded here as well as a relative line numberassociated to the body of the report and an optional display order.The display order with the length provide an optional method ofdisplay code generation.  The generators will output the followingsymbols that will contain the generated code;  1) XUSHD(1:...) Header Lines  2) XUSBD(1:...) Body Lines  3) XUSFT(1:...)

The relative lengthof the body of the report is reduced by the length of the header and thelength of the footer arrays.  The body will be reduced by this length toautomatically generate the footer when $Y is reached.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>report description</td><td>4;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td/><td/><td>This is a description of the intent of this report.
