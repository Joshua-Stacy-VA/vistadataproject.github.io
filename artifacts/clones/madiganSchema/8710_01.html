The two choices are ABSOLUTE and PERCENT.  The ABSOLUTE type of delta check looks for a change in the result based onan exact amount defined in the delta value field.  The MTF also defineshow many days back the system should check for a delta result.  This isdefined in the Lab Site file.  This method is most frequently used withtests like glucose or potassium.  The PERCENT type of delta check looks at the current value and determinesif the result has changed greater than the percentage defined in the delta value field.  This method is commonly used for tests like WBCor PLT.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>delta value</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This field contains the numeric value chosen for the type of delta checkspecified in the `Type of Delta Check' field, either "ABS VALUE" or "PERCENT".  Samples which produce results outside of defined delta checkranges are appropriately flagged.  The delta check flag is not seen on anyreports once the test is certified.  It is an internal check for use by labpersonnel.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>default value</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>If a particular test has the same answer most of the time (i.e., >80% of thetime), entering the common answer in this field will create a "default"answer or prompt.  This prompt will allow the tech to enter the commonanswer by simply hitting the return key when entering, editing orcertifying results.  If there is no common answer, leave this field blank.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>decimal places</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>Enter the number of decimal places allowed for this result.

The text may be otherreference range information relating to special conditions.  Use this field to enter reference ranges not related directly to sex andage.  An example is the hormone reference values.  Often there are criterialike menstrual cycle or gestation age associated with the referenceranges.
