Theycontain the information necessary to indicate the format of the data andthe destination of the message. For outgoing transactions there are two kinds of transaction types: parent and child.  A parent contains no routing or format informationand is used as the name called from an application program.  A child contains full formatting and routing information. The transaction type is also used when processing an incoming message.No parent child relationship exists for incoming transaction types.The destination for an incoming transaction type is a script.  Thisscript contains the information necessary to parse the messageand store it in the database.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>NAME(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>The INTERFACE TRANSACTION TYPE supplies the formatter process ofthe interface with information on how the formatter will handleany particular transaction.  The name must be UNIQUE.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>DESTINATION</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4005.html">4005</a></td><td/><td>This points to the INTERFACE DESTINATION FILE, which contains thedestination for the transaction type.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>SCRIPT</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4006.html">4006</a></td><td/><td>This field contains the name of the script which is run to generatean interface message. The field is automatically stuffed with thename if the script is created using the script generator.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>UNIQUE IDENTIFIER(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>ID</td><td>This field should contain a unique identifier for the transaction type.Its value will be used in the construction of cms elements in the formof routines.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>ACTIVE</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:INACTIVE<br/>1:ACTIVE<br/></td><td/><td>This field designates whether the transaction type is active or inactive.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>PARENT</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4000.html">4000</a></td><td>AC</td><td>The application calls a "parent" transaction type, which does notdirectly generate messages. "Child" transaction types point to the"parent" and do generate messages.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>DEPENDENCY</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>Use this field to indicate the dependency order of the children TTs within aparent TT.  Otherwise leave it blank.The Format controller executes the children TT in the dependency orderentered (from low to high).  The children TT that does not have a dependencyvalue is executed last.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>IN/OUT(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>I:IN<br/>O:OUT<br/></td><td/><td>Designates Outgoing vs Incoming transaction types.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>ACKNOWLEDGE TT</td><td>0;9</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4000.html">4000</a></td><td/><td>If this field is non-null, it indicates that messages of this TransactionType must be acknowledged.  The value placed here is the name of a TransactionType which is used to send the outgoing acknowledge message.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>RETRY RATE</td><td>0;10</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This is the amount of time between attempts to process entries.  Onlyentries with the PENDING status will be retried.Enter a number of hours (nnH), number of minutes (nnM), or number of days(nnD).</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>MAX NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This indicates the maximum number of times that this type of transactionwill be requeued.  If no value is present in this field the default willbe based on the value in the Max # of Attempts field in the InterfaceDestination file.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>ACKNOWLEDGE EXPECTED</td><td>0;12</td><td>12</td><td/><td>This field is used for outgoing transactions to indicate whether or notan acknowledge is to be expected.  This is important in determing thestatus of the transaction after transmission.  If there is no acknowledgerequired, the transaction is COMPLETE after it is successfully sent.Otherwise it's status is SENT (Awaiting Acknowledge) following itssuccessful transmission.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>FORMATTER PROCESS TIME</td><td>0;13</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>If this field is non-null, it will indicate a time at which a transactionof this type should be processed.  This field will remain as the originaltext and not be transformed to a date. This value will be used as theimplicit value of the 4th parameter of the ^INHF call.  Placing a value in the4th parameter will override this value. Leaving this blank equates to NOW. An entry of STAT will force the transaction to the top of the queue.  Examples of valid entry are: T-3@1030, NOW-2H, etc. </td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>FORMAT PRIORITY</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This field is used to prioritize messages as they are processed by theformat controller. Valid values are from 0-10 with 0 (default) being the highest and 10 being lowest. If no priorities are assigned toany transactions, or if they all have the same priority, they willbe processed in the order received.</td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>OUTPUT PROCESS TIME</td><td>0;15</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>If this field is non-null, it will indicate a time at which a transactionof this type should be processed.  This field will remain as the original text and not be transformed to a date. It should be a relative value such asT@0500 or T+1@0200 or NOW-2H.  A value of STAT will force entries to the topof the queue.  Leaving this blank equates to NOW.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>OUTPUT PRIORITY</td><td>0;16</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This field is used to prioritize messages to the output controller.Valid values are from 0-10 with 0 (default) being highest and10 being lowest. If no priorities are assigned to any transactions, orif all transactions have the same priority, they will all be procssedin the order received.</td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>BACKGROUND PROCESS</td><td>0;17</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4004.html">4004</a></td><td/><td>Pointer to an entry in the BACKGROUND PROCESS CONTROL file for a serverbackground job that will be created by this transaction type.  This fieldwill be used during server creation to access the name of the routine torun and to search for the next available server slot.</td></tr><tr><td>.18</td><td>APPLICATION ACK CONDITIONS</td><td>0;18</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>AL:ALWAYS<br/>NE:NEVER<br/>SU:SUCCESS ONLY<br/>ER:ERROR ONLY<br/></td><td/><td>This field specifies the conditions under which an applicationacknowledgement message will be created and returned in responseto an incoming message. It is a set of codes which coincides withthe HL7 specified values for acknowledgements. A value in thisfield will over-ride any value contained in MSH-16 of theincoming message.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DOCUMENTATION</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td/><td/><td>This is a description of this transaction type.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>API SRMC</td><td>3;E1,240</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This is the API Selective Routing M Code.

This screening logic is applicable to outbound parent transaction types only.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>FORMAT CONTROLLER SRMC</td><td>4;E1,240</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This is the Format Controller Selective Routing M Code.
