Periodically theentries in this file, will be packed up into a mail message and sent toG.LEXICON@ISC-SLC.VA.GOV (via GMPTSEND) for consideration for possibleinclusion in the Clinical Lexicon.  After the mail message is sent theentries in this file are deleted.  NOTE:  Entries to this file are only added by users who fail to find a suitable expression while using an application which has an integration agreement with the Clinical Lexicon.  This integration agreement would include an entry in the Subset file (#757.2) defining the application and activating the Unresolved Narrativefunctionality.
