No entry willdefault to ENABLE.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>INTERACTION CHECK</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:ENABLE<br/>1:*** DISABLE ***<br/></td><td/><td>This parameter enables or disables drug interaction checking.  (Allthe other drug checks-duplications, overlaps, allergies, and dosageare not affected by this parameter.)  No entry will default toENABLE.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>SEVERITY</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:SEVERE<br/>2:MODERATE<br/></td><td/><td>  This parameter allows you to limit which interactions are generated by thesystem.  Enter a '1' to include only severe interactions or enter a '2' toinclude all interactions, both severe and moderate.  The severe and moderate interactions are related to how First DataBank ranks interactions.  The following table describes how the parameter relates to First DataBank's ranking of interactions. Severity Parameter           First DataBank's Ranking---------------              ------------------------Severe                       Severe interactions, both well                             documented and not well documented. Moderate                     Moderate interactions that are well documented.  If the parameter is set to moderate (2) ALL interactions will be generated.The system will not allow the generation of only moderate interactions.    </td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>OVERLAP-DEA</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:SCHEDULE 1<br/>2:SCHEDULE 2<br/>3:SCHEDULE 3<br/>4:SCHEDULE 4<br/>5:SCHEDULE 5<br/>9:*** DISABLE CHECK ***<br/></td><td/><td>This parameter sets at what level the system will perform DEA overlapchecking.  For example, if this parameter is set to SCHEDULE 3, the system will generate DEA overlap warnings for drugs defined in thesystem as DEA schedule 1, 2, or 3.  If set to ***DISABLE CHECK***, thesystem will not perform any DEA overlap checking.  No entry willdefault to SCHEDULE 5, the maximum setting.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>OVERLAP-THERAPEUTIC CLASS</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:ENABLE<br/>1:*** DISABLE ***<br/></td><td/><td>This parameter enables or disables all therapeutic classification overlapchecking.  No entry in this field will default to ENABLE.   The system will check First DataBank's therapeutic classification of all the drug's active ingredients as well as the therapeutic classification of the entire drug product. For example, Actifed with Codeine has thefollowing three ingredients and their respective classifications: Ingredients                  Classifications---------------              ---------------Codeine                       Analgesics, Narcotic Tripolidine                   AntihistaminesPseudoephedrine               Sympathomimetic agents Any drug that contains ingredients with the above classifications has the potential to cause an overlap warning.              In addition, Actifed with Codeine is classified as a Cough and Coldpreparation.  Any other drug product with an identical classification would also produce an overlap warning.              Overlap checking will take into account the drug product's route when performing overlap checking. Both drugs must have either systemicroutes or identical non-systemic routes for overlap checking to be performed. </td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>DUPLICATION CHECK</td><td>0;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:ENABLE<br/>1:*** DISABLE ***<br/></td><td/><td>This parameter enables or disables all duplication checking.  Noentry will default to ENABLE.   A duplicate warning occurs whenever identical drugs or drugs that reference the same drug product are prescribed for a patient. For example, if an HCP prescribed identical drugs to a patient a duplicate warning would be generated.   If two different drugs referencing the same drug product (same generic name,route, strength and form) via the Primary NDC Number were prescribedto a patient, a duplicate warning would also be generated. If a duplicate warning is generated, no overlap checking will be performed. However, if the duplicate checking parameter is disabled, thesystem will continue to perform overlap checking and generate overlap overlap warnings against identical drugs or drugs belonging to identical drug products.    </td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>ALLERGY CHECK</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:ENABLE<br/>1:*** DISABLE ***<br/></td><td/><td>This parameter enables or disables all allergy checking. No entry willdefault to ENABLE.   There are three ways an allergy warning can be generated. First, a patientis allergic to a drug and an ingredient of that drug is ordered for thepatient. Second, a patient is allergic to a drug that belongs to anallergy class and a drug belonging to the same allergy class is orderedfor that patient. Finally, the patient is allergic to an allergy class and a drug belonging to the same allergy class is ordered for that patient. </td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>DOSAGE CHECK</td><td>0;9</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:ENABLE<br/>1:*** DISABLE ***<br/></td><td/><td>This parameter enables or disables dosage checking.  A blank parameteris the same as ENABLE.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>EDITED DATE/TIME</td><td>0;10</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td/><td>This field records the date and time of the last edit/change to the contentsof this file.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>EDITED BY USER</td><td>0;11</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td/><td>This field records the name of the user who last wrote data into this file, whether that data contained any changes or not.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>PREGNANCY CHECK</td><td>0;13</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:ENABLE<br/>1:***DISABLE<br/></td><td/><td>The PREGNANCY CHECK is set to enable PREGNANCY check</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>PREGNANCY FDA SEVERITY</td><td>0;14</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:BCDX<br/>2:CDX<br/>3:DX<br/></td><td/><td>The filtering of PREGNANCY SEVERITY CODE</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div>
