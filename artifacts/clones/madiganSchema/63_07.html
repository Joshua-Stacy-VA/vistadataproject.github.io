The Lab Method contains the necessaryreferences to determine the appropriate LOINC Time Aspect, LOINC Property,LOINC System/Sample (which is further linked via the Topography Fieldfile), LOINC Scale, and optionally LOINC Method. Data in this field is the actual LOINC code value determined for this test.The data is the same as the .01 field of the LOINC Codes file (file #8199).Note this field is NOT a pointer field. This is to allow test results andLOINC codes to be assigned that may not be in the LOINC codes file. A LOINCcode which is not in CHCS may be captured from an off-board system via anHL-7 message when the off-board system is using a different version of theLOINC tables. Data in this field should not be modified by the user and is generallyhidden from most data entry mechanisms.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>alert</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This field stores designations for abnormal results.Examples:  "H", "L", "H*", "L*".</td></tr><tr><td>1.11</td><td>appended/amended rnr</td><td>.11;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="63_775.html">63.775</a></td><td/><td>This is the multiple that stores the ID and date/timeof the Health Care Provider that tossed, saved, printed,or discarded appended or amended results in Review NewResults option.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>enter date/time</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td/><td>This field contains the date and time the result was entered and filed.
