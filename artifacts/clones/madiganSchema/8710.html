The file contains thesite/specimen multiple which was formerly part of the Lab Test file.Rather than creating a new test to reflect a change in method that resultsin new reference ranges, multiple methods with their associated referenceranges can be designated for a test.  The methods can be specified as adefault method or can be changed at the time of result entry.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>LAB METHOD(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the lab method being defined.

If the result is always a number, select the result type NUMERIC.

Use the operators +, -, / and *for addition, subtraction, division and multiplication respectively.Use the variables created in the "LAB TEST USED IN CALCULATION" multiple.Example: T7=T4+T3  The variables are T4=C(1) and T3=C(2).  The formulaentered for this calculation would be C(1)+C(2).   The system will read the calculations from left to right.  If the formularequires a specific portion to be calculated separately, enclose that section in parentheses.  In the example C(1)*100/(100+C(2)), if the parentheses were not included the system will calculate C(1)*100 then divide by 100 and then add C(2).  With the parentheses the system willcalculate 100+C(2) then divide it into C(1)*100.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div>
