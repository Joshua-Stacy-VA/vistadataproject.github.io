Thisvalue allows the user to specify when to begin a run of a duplicate patient search. When the user accesses the field, the system will suggest a defaultdate/time which has been assigned by the MTF. This default date/timeis usually set in the late evening or early morning hours so as tohave minimal impact on the operation of the system during businesshours. The user can accept the suggested default time or can enter a new date/time to override the suggested date/time default.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>END RUN TIME</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td/><td>A user-entered date/time field which allows the user to indicate whenthe system should stop processing of an uncompleted duplicate patientreport run. This field allows the user to stop processing of aduplicate patient report that has not completed by normal businesshours in order to minimize the impact this pending report has on thedaylight hours operation of the system. If this field is used to actually stop the processing of an uncompleted duplicate patient report run, the processing for the duplicate patient report will resume again at the designated start time previously entered by the user.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>USER</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td/><td>The name of the user who is running the duplicate patient report.
