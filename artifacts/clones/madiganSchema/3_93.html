This will be the name of themachine on which the SMTP services run.  For example, on a threenode system with SMTP running on node A, "A.SAIC.COM" would be thedomain name. NOTE: Each node of the system has a domain name, but the network       services for MailMan will run on a single node.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>active</td><td>0;2</td><td>12</td><td>AC</td><td>This flag indicates whether an entry in the file will be used by the system.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>error log retention</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>When the SMTP errors are purged from the error log, this field indicateshow old (in days) an error must be before it is removed from the SMTPERROR LOG File (file #3.94).</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>statistics log retention</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>Indicates the number of days the network mail statistics should beretained before they are purged from the statistics log. To prevent network mail statistics from being stored, this field shouldbe set to zero. The main disadvantages of not retaining this informationare that it will not be possible to determine if a user is receiving orsending too much mail, or if a user is sending or receiving unauthorizedmail.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>days to retry</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>The number of days to retry a message. The value in the DAYS TO RETRY field excludes the days that the systemmight be down, and/or when the SMTP network interface is shut down.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>configuration</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_931.html">3.931</a></td><td/><td>This field indicates the configuration used by SMTP to send and receivemail.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>no of servers</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This field indicates the number of transceivers that should run at anygiven time.  A transceiver is an SMTP process that will send mail to other systems.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>send frequency</td><td>0;8</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>Identifies (in minutes) how frequently the MailMan SMTP transceiversshould check if there is mail to send.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>no of dns servers</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>Number of DNS servers to start when network MailMan is started.If all of the CPUs at the site have network access, this flag should be set to zero.  Some sites do not have network capabilities on all of their nodes (e.g. a three node site might only have MultiNet installedon the A node).  If access is not available to the network from allsite nodes, a user might be logged on to a node that cannot performa domain name service check.  To give users the ability to use thedomain name service on all nodes at a site were you cannot access thenetwork from all nodes, this field should be set to the number of background domain name service daemons to start. If all site nodes have access to the network, the functionality of this field does not haveto be used.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>node(+)</td><td>0;10</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This field indicates on which node the SMTP service should run.  Forexample, if the site has three nodes named TWVA, TWVB, and TWVC, andwants SMTP to run on TWVA, "TWVA" should be entered in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>retry interval(+)</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This field indicates how frequently a message should be retried.  Eachtime a message is retried, this interval is doubled.  For example, ifthe retry interval is set to 1 hour, the second attempt to send themessage will be made 1 hour from the time it was sent.  The third attemptwill be made 2 hours from the second time it was retried, and so on.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>dns interactive max wait</td><td>0;12</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>If the site is running DNS servers, then this field indicates how longa user should wait for a response from the DNS servers before timingout.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>verify access</td><td>0;13</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:DISALLOW VERIFY<br/>1:ALLOW VERIFY<br/></td><td/><td>This field controls how your site will use the Simple Mail TransferProtocol command called VRFY (verify).  This command allows remotesystems to verify users on your system.  It is useful when a useron a remote system does not know the mailbox name for one of yourusers.  For example, if system A verifies smith@B, then system Bwill return to A the full mailbox name of user smith. 0 - Disallow Verify CommandIf your site does not wish to allow remote systems to verify users onyour system, enter '0' into this field. 1  - Allow Verify CommandIf your site would like to allow remote systems to verify users on yoursystem, enter '1' into this field.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>expand access</td><td>0;14</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:DISALLOW EXPAND<br/>1:ALLOW EXPAND<br/>2:ALLOW AMBIGUOUS EXPAND<br/></td><td/><td>This field controls how your site will use the Simple Mail TransferProtocol command called EXPN (expand).  This command allows remotesystems to display the members of your mail groups.  This is usefulto remote users who want to send to one of your mail groups but isunsure if it is the correct one.  For example, if system A expandsgroup1@B, then system B will return to A all of the members of themail group called group1. 0 - Disallow Expand CommandIf your site does not wish to allow remote systems to expand yourmail groups, enter '0' into this field. 1 - Allow Expand CommandIf your site would like to allow remote systems to expand mail groupson your system, enter '1' into this field. 2 - Allow Ambiguous LookupsWhen a mail group is ambiguous, it means that the system requesting theexpand did not provide enough information to find a mailbox.  In thisinstance, the requesting user would receive a 'mail group ambiguous'response.  This condition would occur if, for example, the requesting siteperformed a expand on group1 and there existed more than one group1 onyour system (meaning, more than one mail groups that began with theletters 'group1').  It is possible, however, to return all of theambiguous mail groups.  Using the previous example, if '2' is entered intothe field, then the requesting site will receive all of the mail groupsthat begin with 'group1' rather than a mail group ambiguous response.Once these mail groups are returned to the requesting site, it can thenuse the exact mail group name to perform a expand.  All of the membersof the mail group will then be returned.  It is important to notethat if '2' is entered into this field, remote systems expanding's' will receive all mail groups that begin with 's.'</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
