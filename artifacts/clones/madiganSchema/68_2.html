The workdocument name represents the name of the specific work or where the test isperformed (i.e. "SPECIAL CHEMISTRY" or "MANUAL BENCH"), a specific instrumentused to perform the test (i.e. "ASTRA" OR "COULTER S+4"), or the name of thetest which will be run on the document (i.e. "LITHIUM" or "CARDIAC ENZYMES").NOTE:  A work document must be defined for interface automated instruments.This entry will be associated with an entry in the AUTO INSTRUMENTfile (#62.4).</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>ENTRIES/BATCH</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>Enter the number of entries to include on a work document each time a batchbuilds and prints.  The number should include any standards or controls forthe work document.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>LAST BATCH USED</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This is the number of the last batch built by the system.  DO NOT EDIT the entries in this field.

If the tests are resulted and the work document is printed the format returns to thevertical format so the results can be reviewed. The load list can also be set up to expand the panels when it is printed.  When a panel prints all the tests print on the panel aredisplayed separated by commas. Horizontal: The patient and accession information are minimal and printto the left side of the work document.  The tests print across the topof the work document. If the accession has the test ordered a "___" prints under the test header.  If the test is resulted the resultprints.  This format will only handle up to 10 tests, and the testswould need to have names and results that do not take up too many spaces. Template: The lab manager uses the Inquire to the Files option of theAd Hoc Menu to create a custom template for a work document.  The patientand accession information is followed by the contents of the customtemplate.  If this format is chosen, one entry prints per page. 3/4 Columnar: The patient and accession information is followed bythe panel tests listed vertically in 3 or 4 columns.  The results also print on the work documents in the columns. 5 Spaces or Lines: The patient and accession information is followedby either 5 double spaced lines or 10 spaces.  This provides a space for a user to write notes about the test for reference whenthe final result is entered.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>EXPAND LOADLIST</td><td>0;7</td><td>12</td><td/><td>Enter 'YES' in this field to print the individual tests on a panelwhen the Loadlist prints.

The system will then ask for a name of the templatejust created.  The name entered after creating the work processingfield is the same one entered in this field.

If the sort order is by priority,the accessions will appear on the work document with STATs and otherhigh priorities printing first. Within each priority, the accessionswill sort by the date of the accession.  For example, routine prioritieswill have the oldest accessions appearing at the top of the routineportion of the list. If the sort order is by accession, the entries on the work documentwill print in numerical order of the number part of the accession.Neither priority nor the date of accession will be used in thesort critieria.  </td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>HORIZONTAL SPACING</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>If the lab manager has designated the format of this work documentas horizontal, the horizontal spacing needs to be defined.  Thelab manager can space the tests according to how many are expectedto fit on the work document.  If only a few tests are planned forthe work document the spacing can be set so the tests are printedon the work document evenly.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>SENSITIVE</td><td>0;11</td><td>12</td><td/><td>Enter 'YES' in this field if this work document is used for sensitivetesting.

The purposeis to keep multiple users from competing for the same work document at thesame time.  If the flag is left set, enter "NO" to continue building loadlists. When the field is set at "YES" the user will see theprompt "WAITING FOR ANOTHER BUILD TO FINISH" when attempting to build the list.

Different combinations of tests may be defined to include on the particular work document.  Each work document must have at least one template defined, but may have othertemplates. When more than one template exists, the users will be prompted with "Build ALL templates?" when building the document.  The user may chooseto build all existing templates onto the same document or can specify one template.  If only one template is defined, the user will not see this prompt.  The simplest example of a template might be for a single test.The work document name is "Lithium", the template defined is named "Lithium", and the only test included on the template is "Lithium".  Certain circumstances may require two templates.  There may be a templatecalled "Standard" for the regular day shift operations and a "PM/MN"template for the off-peak hours.  </td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>ROUTINE RUN TIME</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="68_3.html">68.3</a></td><td/><td>Enter the time in military format for the time of day for the routinerun time for this work document.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>LINKED</td><td>0;5</td><td>12</td><td/><td>The lab user enters a "YES" in this field to indicate this work documentis a linked work document.
