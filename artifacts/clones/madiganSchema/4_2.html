Each name in this file corresponds to the right sideof a MailMan address-the part following the "@". Domains may have synonyms, allowing users to name sites with one name,while MailMan uses the more formal Domain Naming conventions. This file also controls whether messages are queued for immediate transmissionand into what queue they are dropped.  Any domain may have a relay domain,which controls the routing as follows: If a domain has a named relay domain, the message is put in the queue forthe relay domain. If not, and the domain has a TRANSMISSION SCRIPT, then the message is putin the queue for that domain. Otherwise, the message is put in the queue for the Parent domain, as definedat MailMan initialization time.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>NAME(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This name is the exact name of the domain, as used in network addressing The name must begin with an alpha, then be followed by only alpha,numeric, or "-" characters, for a total less than 13 characters.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>FLAGS</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>AC</td><td>Flags can be entered in any order.  The absence of flags means the domainis opened to network traffic.Flag descriptions:  S = Send immediate.  If a message is sent to this domain, the message will     transmitted immediately if the 'S' flag is present, otherwise the     message will sit in the postmaster queue and wait to be polled (see     flag 'P') or be triggered out by an incoming message.  C = Closed domain.  Messages may not be sent to a domain that is 'closed'.  P = Poll this domain.  If a message for this domain is sitting in the     postmaster queue, polling may be turned on for this domain to transmit     messages at a given time.  The option XMPOLL must be set up to run     at user defined times for this flag to be operational.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>SECURITY KEY</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This field, if defined, names a security key which must be held by the sender.

This meansthat the sending domain must open the link.  This allows an extra measure of security, to insure that the sending domain establishes thelink.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>RELAY DOMAIN</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4_2.html">4.2</a></td><td/><td>This is the name of the domain, if any, to which messages are to bealways routed.  For example, if traffic from Los Angeles to Washingtonis always to be routed through San Francisco, then the RELAY DOMAIN forLos Angeles is defined to be San Francisco.   The relay domain overides any other path determination processes, suchas scripts and parent domains.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>TRANSMISSION SCRIPT</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4_21.html">4.21</a></td><td/><td>Enter code to create a script for transmitting data.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>SYNONYM</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4_23.html">4.23</a></td><td/><td>Other names by which this domain is known.</td></tr><tr><td>5.5</td><td>STATION</td><td>0;13</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This field is obsolete with 4.40 SMTP MailMan.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>MCTS ROUTING INDICATOR</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>This is a three character routing indicator for the VADATS network'sMCTS terminal system.statistics reflect the messages as they are actually transmitted, notas they are addressed.</td></tr><tr><td>6.2</td><td>DHCP ROUTING INDICATOR</td><td>0;14</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>AD</td><td>This field is obsolete with 4.40 SMTP MailMan.</td></tr><tr><td>6.5</td><td>MAILMAN HOST</td><td>0;12</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This field is obsolete with 4.40 SMTP MailMan.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>OUTGOING MESSAGE COUNT</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This is a count of the number of messages which have been transmitted to thisdomain since the counter was last set to zero.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>OUTGOING LINE COUNT</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This is a count of the number of lines of text which have been transmittedto this domain since the counter was last set to zero.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>INCOMING MESSAGE COUNT</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This is a count of the number of messages which have been received from thisdomain since the counter was last reset.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>INCOMING LINE COUNT</td><td>0;8</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>This is the count of the number of lines which have been received from thisdomain since the counter was last reset.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>ERROR LAST REPORTED</td><td>0;9</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td/><td>This is the date/time at which a physical link error was last reported to the network log device.

The namefile of the DEVICE file can be a literal (such as MINIENGINE-OUT orCPU B LINK) but the $I field must match with the correct cpu $I.If the link is physically located on a cpu other than the one the networkmail is being sent from, the local DEVICE file MUST reflect that in theOTHER CPU field of the device file if the transmission is to take placeimmediately.  If it is not identified properly, the message will go intoa queue to be processed the next time a network message is sent from orrecieved on the processor with the physical link.NOTE:  The DEVICE files on all cpu's must have matching device names       to correctly route the message to the proper cpu for sending.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>LEVEL 1 NAME</td><td/><td>COMPUTED</td><td/><td/><td>This computed expression field represents the last piece of the IPaddress (field #.01) delimited by ".". This field is obsolete with 4.40 SMTP MailMan.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>LEVEL 2 NAME</td><td/><td>COMPUTED</td><td/><td/><td>This computed expression field represents the last two pieces of theIP address (.01 field) delimited by ".". This field is obsolete with 4.40 SMTP MailMan.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>LEVEL 3 NAME</td><td/><td>COMPUTED</td><td/><td/><td>This computed expression field represents the last three pieces of theIP address (field #.01) delimited by ".". This field is obsolete with 4.40 SMTP MailMan.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>LEVEL 4 NAME</td><td/><td>COMPUTED</td><td/><td/><td>This computed expression field represents the last four pieces of the asthe IP address (field #.01) delimited by ".". This field is obsolete with 4.40 SMTP MailMan.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div>
