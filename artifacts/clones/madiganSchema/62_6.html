Thisallows the user to select entries from the file using this number.  Eachentry has a unique number automatically assigned to it.  When defining anew entry in the file, the user may specify an unused number and the newentry will be internally assigned that number.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the unique name for each LSI.  Try to use a name thatis meaningful to describe this particular LSI.  Usually LSI's have namesthat either correspond to a specific instrument (for direct-connect LSI's),or have names such as LSI-1, LSI-2.  If you have many LSI hardware devices,you may want to consider including the location of the LSI in this name.If your site has many remote clinics or divisions, using the clinic/divisionname in the LSI name will help identify the location of the LSI.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>interface type(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>LAASTM:ASTM Std 1381-91 LLP<br/>LACOM:PDP-11/53 Minicomputer LSI<br/>LAGIS:DATA INNOVATIONS IM LSI<br/>LALONE:DIRECT CONNECT STANDARD<br/>LAPOLL:DIRECT CONNECT-INTERVAL POLL<br/>LASTAR:DIRECT CONNECT-SNGL CHAR. READ<br/>LASYS:GDC 2100 microcomputer LSI<br/></td><td></td><td>This field defines the physical type of LSI that is being used.  There areseveral types of LSI that can be used, some utilize an actual hardware devicethat concentrates the data from multiple instruments onto one communicationslink to CHCS.  Others are simply logical representations of a directcommunications link between CHCS and a single instrument. Select the LSI type that is appropriate for this entry: LAASTM is used for directly connected instruments that utilize the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) Standard #1381-91.  The title of this specification is:  Specification for Low-Level Protocol to Transfer Messages Between Clinical Laboratory Instruments and Computer Systems. LACOM is used when the LSI is a PDP-11/53 minicomputer.  This LSI type will only be used to connect uni-directional instruments to CHCS.  These instruments simply transmit their data without any need for a response from the receiving system. LAGIS is used when the LSI is a DATA INNOVATIONS Instrument Manager LSI. This LSI uses a personal computer to connect the instruments to CHCS.  It also performs translation of the custom instrument data, converting the data into a minimal HL-7 data format for transmission to CHCS.  This LSI utilizes the CHCS GIS (Generic Interface System) for communications between CHCS and the LSI.  All instrument interface issues are handled the DII IM system. LALONE is used when interfacing a bi-directional instrument directly with  the CHCS system.  This type of LSI is used for most directly connected instrument interfaces.  However, there are other types that can and/or should be used, depending on the needs of the instrument protocol.  Please check the deployment guide or Instrument Interface Parameters file for the instrument being interfaced to determine if this is the type of LSI that should be used. LAPOLL is a variation of LALONE.  It is used for directly connected instruments that required CHCS to occasionally poll the instrument for data to be transmitted.  LAPOLL will transmit to the instrument an instrument-specific poll message requesting any available data be  transmitted to CHCS. This poll message is transmitted at instrument-specific intervals.  Please check the deployment guide or Instrument Interface Parameters file for the instrument being interfaced to determine if this is the type of LSI that should be used. LASTAR is another variation of LALONE that is also used for directly connected instruments.  LASTAR is used when the format of the data from the instrument contains large amounts of text without message termination characters or when the message termination characters must be retained for effective processing of the data.  LALONE will not retain the message termination characters, but LASTAR will.  LASTAR can also accept a virtually unlimited amount of data without a message terminator character. Please check the deployment guide or the Instrument Interface Parameters file for the instrument being interfaced to determine if this is the type of LSI that should be used. LASYS is used when the LSI is a GDC 2100 microcomputer.  This LSI type is the first generation of LSI hardware devices, and is only used to connect uni-directional instruments to CHCS.  These instruments simply transmit their data without any need for a response from the receiving system.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>interface device</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains the entry from the DEVICE file that will be used tocommunicate with this LSI.  An entry in the DEVICE file must exist priorto building or activating the LSI.  The entry in the DEVICE file willspecify the physical system device that will be used and the communicationscharacteristics of that device.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>monitor device</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td></td><td>This field is no longer used by the CHCS system.  The field may be deletedin a future version of the software. This identifies the device that you could use to monitor data flow fromthe LSI to a temporary CHCS file.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>error device</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td></td><td>This field specifies a device which will print bulletin notification whena significant event occurs with the data transmission and/or reception withan LSI.  The bulletin will contain the specifics of the event.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>notify person</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td></td><td>This field specifies the user which will receive bulletin notificationwhen a significant event occurs with the data transmission and/or receptionwith an LSI.

Then you must set thistime-out short enough in order to process the messages efficiently. Also if the instrument has preset time limit during which it assumesmessages to be processed, then this READ TIME-OUT must be shorterthan that. Note that this field is valid only for bidirectional instrumentsthat are connected directly to CHCS Host Computer.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>read terminator</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field defines Auto Instrument message terminators using their ASCIIcodes. The default message terminator is a <CR>. However, if the AutoInstrument does not send a <CR>, but uses e.g. <ETX>, the communicationprogram waits in a READ command until time-out. To avoid this you can define an instrument specific messageterminator(s) here. If you want to define more then one terminator,separate them with commas. For example, if the instrument sends messagesthat end with <ETX> or <ETB>, you can enter: 3,23  Note that the message terminators are no longer part of the message. Please check the deployment guide or Instrument Interface Parameters filefor the instrument being interfaced to determine if this field should bepopulated and appropriate data to be entered. This field only effects bidirectional instruments that are connecteddirectly to CHCS Host Computer.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>dii error mail group</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_8.html">3.8</a></td><td></td><td>This pointer allows the site to specify which mail group is to receivebulletin notification when the system receives an error code/string thatis not currently on file for a particular instrument.  At the time theunknown error is processed, it will be added to the Auto Instrument fileentries for that instrument with a default action code of 2, indicatingDisplay the Error in TAR, but do not file the result.  The error code/stringwill also be entered as a new code/string combination in the DII ErrorInitialization file.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>dii inbound process</td><td>0;11</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows the site to specify the name of the GIS background processthat controls data transfer between the DII LSI and CHCS for a particularLSI file entry.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>dii outbound process</td><td>0;12</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows the site to specify the name of the background processthat controls data transfer between CHCS and the DII LSI for a particularLSI file entry.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>read maximum</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field defines the maximum number of characters that should be read using a single READ command.
