The systemwill not be able to validate the logical view of the rule, so the rulemay not behave correctly when executed. The user should further designa number of formal testing scenarios to allow the user to more fullyvalidate the condition.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>rule name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This field specifies the name of a particular rule.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>description</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td/><td/><td>This is a free-text entry to describe what the Rule will do and its purpose. Example: Auto-validate when result is within normal range.
