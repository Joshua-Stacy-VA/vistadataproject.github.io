If the system finds one or moreradiology exams that use barium within this date range, then it willdisplay a warning.   For example, if you enter 7 in this field, then the system will check for duplicate barium exams that are scheduled up to 7 days before the proposed exam appointment date, on the proposed exam appointment date, and 7 days after, for a total of 15 days.   If you enter 0 in this field or leave it blank, then no barium check will be performed.  </td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>DAYS TO CHECK FOR CONTRAST</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td/><td/><td>Enter the number of days before and after procedures are ordered and/or scheduled that you want the system to check the patient's Radiology Exam file entries for exams that use intravascular (IV) contrast media.

On the fourth day, the system will remove the report from the resident's or interpretingradiologist's queue and send it to the queue of the supervising radiologistidentified on that report.
