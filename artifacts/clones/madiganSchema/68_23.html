After entry of the control, a prompt will display tospecify the control's rank.  The rank determines which control will appear beforeanother more than one control has been designated  to be placed at thebeginning of the document.  After specifying the rank, the prompt to "Selectcontrols to begin work doc." will display again.  This is a multiple field,and will allow placement of as many control names in the field as necessary. If the same control is to be used more than once at the start of eachdocument, enter the full control name in quotes.  Controls entered in thisfield will be accessioned on every "build" of this profile on the workdocument.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>controls to end doc.</td><td>5;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="68_29.html">68.29</a></td><td/><td>Enter the name of the control to be placed at the end of the work document.This multiple field will also ask to specify each control name's rank (ororder).  These controls will be accessioned on every "build" of this profileon the work document, and will always appear immediately following the lastaccession number sequence (patient specimen) on the document.  Example:  Ifa"Lithium" work document generates 15 entries of patient accession, thecontrol names entered in this field will always appear in the availableentry, or in this case, on entry #16.  Both this field and the previousone point to valid entries in the LAB CONTROL NAME file (#62.3), sothe control names entered in these fields must first be defined in file#62.3.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>related test</td><td>10;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="68_31.html">68.31</a></td><td/><td>Results from a related test within the same order group, if available,may be displayed on the work document.
