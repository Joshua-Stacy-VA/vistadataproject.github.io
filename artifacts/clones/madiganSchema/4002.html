It isexpressed in the format of an Internet Domain Name, e.g., FWVA.SAIC.COM</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>default max number of attempts(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This indicates the maximum number of times that transactions will berequeued.  This is a system default.  The system will first check thetransaction type, then the destination to determine the maximum numberof retries.  If no value is found then the value of this fieldwill be used.  If no value is present in this field the defaultis zero (0).</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>default retry rate(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the default amount of time between attempts to process entries inthe UIF.  Only PENDING entries will be retried.  Enter a number of hours(nnH), number of minutes (nnM), or a number of days (nnD).</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>priority for background tasks</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used to indicate the priority at which spawned backgroundtasks should be run.  A value of 0 or null will use the default priority.Otherwise, 1 is lowest priority, 10 is highest and 5 is normal.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>general purpose output servers(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field determines the number of processes which will be created by theOutput Controller fail-safe process.  Entering a value greater than one willcause the Output Controller to operate in multi-thread mode, in whichadditional jobs will be created to perform the tasks. This is the number of Output Controller server processes and must be greaterthan zero.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>message id prefix(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the standard prefix which will be used to create Message ID's.  Forexample, if the prefix is HOST the first message created will have an IDof HOST1, the second will have HOST2, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>formatter servers</td><td>0;10</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of Format Controller Server processes that will be createdby the Format Controller fail-safe process. </td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>uif/error retention days(+)</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of days old a transaction (in error, complete, or negativeacknowledged state) or an error must be in order for it to be purged bythe GIS autopurge program.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>variable storage location</td><td>0;12</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:LOCAL, CAN MOVE TO GLOBAL<br/>1:LOCAL<br/>2:GLOBAL<br/></td><td></td><td>This field describes where data processed by an interface script is to beheld.  If LOCAL, CAN MOVE TO GLOBAL the data will be kept in a local arrayuntil the local storage gets too low then it will be moved to a global.The overhead of this method is that the checking needs to be doneperiodically. If LOCAL is chosen, data will be kept in a local array and no checking willbe done for remaining storage - only use this method when you are surethe amount of data will not exceed local storage. If GLOBAL is chosen, data will be kept in a global and no checking willbe done for remaining storage - use this method when you know that almostall transactions will overflow the local storage.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>minutes to be current(+)</td><td>0;13</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is maximum number of minutes old any pending or failed messages may befor the Interface System to be deemed "current".  If there are anytransactions with a status other than complete outside this number ofminutes, then the interface system will report itself as "not current".</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>$s for variable overflow</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is used in conjunction with the SCRIPT VARIABLE STORAGE LOCATION fieldto indicate at what value of $S an overflow to a global will occur if itis enabled.If omitted, a default value of 2500 will be used.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>selective routing debug flag</td><td>0;16</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:OFF<br/>1:ON<br/></td><td></td><td>This is the selective routing debug flag.  If ON, selective routingdecisions will be logged in the Interface Error file.  If OFF or null,automatic logging of suppressed messages will NOT occur in the InterfaceError file.</td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>criteria retention days</td><td>0;17</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is how many days Interface Criteria will be kept since the last dateaccessed.  </td></tr><tr><td>.18</td><td>max uif retention days</td><td>0;18</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the maximum number of days a transaction will be kept in the system.It will be purged by the GIS autopurge program regardless of status.</td></tr><tr><td>.19</td><td>compiled script status</td><td>0;19</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:VALID<br/>1:INVALID<br/></td><td></td><td>Flag to indicate whether Scripts are currently in a valid or invalidstatus.  Running a Recompile All Scripts (RECOMP^INHSZ) will set backto a valid status.  Actions such as changing transform code in theSCRIPT GENERATOR DATA TYPE file (#4012.1) file will set this to invalid.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>code to build user vars(+)</td><td>1;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the MUMPS code which should be executed to set up a user's symboltable which includes their DUZ array.Example code would be 'D DVARS^XQ1' for SAIC-Care software.</td></tr><tr><td>2.05</td><td>scrolling mode</td><td>2;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates if input should be through scrolling modeor full-screen mode.  If the system does not have CHCS v4.2 withconsolidated tools the field should have the value of "YES".</td></tr><tr><td>2.06</td><td>uif autopurge active</td><td>2;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Must be set to YES for the INH AUTOPURGE to run.  Can be set to NO toABORT the INH AUTOPURGE if it is currently running.</td></tr><tr><td>2.07</td><td>purge per task</td><td>2;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value in this field will be multiplied by one thousand.  The resulting value determines the maximum number of Universal Interface entries that willbe examined by the interface purge process. If the number entered is lessthan the number of records requiring review for purge eligibility, additionalpurge tasks will follow until completion or shutdown.    Any positive number entered is interpreted in 1K units. If the field is left blank, a single process will be used for the entire purge.  </td></tr><tr><td>2.08</td><td>shutdown purge time</td><td>2;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field indicates when the purge task must stopprocessing.  The value 0000 will not be accepted because it is ambiguous.</td></tr><tr><td>2.09</td><td>retask delay seconds</td><td>2;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This value defines the number of seconds to delay the tasking of subsequentpurge jobs. Tasking of the initial day's purge job is unaffected by the valueentered, and it will start on the time set for the Acceptable Purge Timefield. If the value of the Purge Per Task field is null or greater than thenumber of records for purge eligibility review, one tasked job will be usedfor continuous record purging.  </td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>dedicated servers</td><td>3;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4002_01.html">4002.01</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple is used to specify a number of dedicated Output ControllerServer processes to be established for the INTERFACE DESTINATIONsspecified. Any destination entered in this multiple will have its transactionsprocessed by a dedicated set of processes.</td></tr><tr><td>4.01</td><td>max failed real deers connects</td><td>4;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>  This field specifies a threshold for the Maximum # of Failed Interactive   Connection attempts for the HIPAA X12 Interface. When this threshold is  exceeded, users are notified to take action.</td></tr><tr><td>4.02</td><td>max failed batch deers connect</td><td>4;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows a user to specify a number for failed attempts, after whicha bulletin will be sent to a predefined set of users. The system will defaultto 10 failed attempts. The interval for accumulating the number of attemptswill be 30 minutes. At the end of each 30-minute interval the count of failedbatch attempts will be reset, and the tracking of failures will beginagain. </td></tr><tr><td>4.03</td><td>max deers real response delay</td><td>4;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td> This field specifies the maximum delay the GIS will allow in receiving  an interactive response from DEERS. When this threshold is exceeded, users are notified to take action.</td></tr><tr><td>4.04</td><td>max deers batch response delay</td><td>4;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field specifies the maximum delay the GIS will allow in receiving    a batch response from DEERS. When this threshold is exceeded, users  are notified to take action.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>interface system active</td><td>ACT;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates if the Generic Interface System is active inthis environment.  If this field is set to NO then no interfacebackground processes will be allowed to start.
