The combination of subscript, file/subfile, and fieldallows the system to find other fixed attributes for determining the LOINCcode during result entry. If an attribute is not defined, that information is to be inherited from the test and/or accession being resulted, whichever is appropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>loinc component</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8188_1.html">8188.1</a></td><td></td><td>The LOINC Component Name is the name of the component or analyte measured.Examples are "GLUCOSE" for a Chemistry test, "MICROORGANISM IDENTIFIED" for a Microbiology test, "GENTAMICIN" for an Antibiotic Susceptibility test,or "REPORT.TOTAL" for an Anatomic Pathology test.  A LOINC Component Namemust be entered to capture a LOINC Code for a test result. This field holds a default LOINC Component to be used whenever this fieldis populated during result entry. If this field is null, the LOINC componentwill be inherited from either the test being resulted or other appropriatefile linked to the accession or result being entered. This field should not be edited by site personnel.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>loinc property</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8188_2.html">8188.2</a></td><td></td><td>The LOINC Property distinguishes between different kinds of quantities relating to the same substance. Examples are MCNC (Mass Concentration), SCNC (Substance Concentration), PRID (Presence or Identity). A LOINCProperty must be entered to capture a LOINC Code for the test result. This field holds a default LOINC Property to be used whenever this fieldis populated during result entry. If this field is null, the LOINC propertywill be inherited from either the test being resulted or other appropriatefile linked to the accession or result being entered.  This field should not be edited by site personnel.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>loinc time aspect</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8188_3.html">8188.3</a></td><td></td><td>The LOINC Time Aspect is the length of time for which a property is measuredfor a test result. It may be a single point in time or a time interval.Examples are PT (Point in Time), 1H (1 Hour), 24H (24 Hours), 2D (2 Days).A LOINC Time Aspect must entered to capture a LOINC Code for the testresult. This field holds a default LOINC Time Aspect to be used whenever this fieldis populated during result entry. If this field is null, the LOINC TimeAspect will be inherited from either the test being resulted or other appropriate file linked to the accession or result being entered. This field should not be edited by site personnel.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>loinc system/sample</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8188_4.html">8188.4</a></td><td></td><td>The LOINC System/Sample is the type of specimen on which a lab test isperformed. Examples are SER (Serum), SPT (Sputum), BLD (Whole Blood), UR(Urine). A LOINC System/Sample must be entered to capture a LOINC Code forthe lab test result. This field holds a default LOINC System/Sample to be used whenever thisfield is populated during result entry.

The LOINC Scale is the scale of measure of a test. It maybe Quantitative, Ordinal, Quantitative or Ordinal, Nominal, Narrative, or"Multi". Quantitative is when the result is a numeric value that relates toa continuous numeric scale. Ordinal refers to results with ordered categoricresponses (1+,2+,3+, positive, negative). Quantitative or Ordinal means thetest can be reported as either Quantitative or Ordinal. Nominal refers toresults that have categories of appearance that do not have a naturalordering (yellow, clear, bloody). Narrative is text, such as the descriptionof a microscopic part of a surgical test. "Multi" is many separate resultsstructured as one piece of text. This field holds a default LOINC Scale to be used whenever this fieldis populated during result entry. If this field is null, the LOINC Scalewill be inherited from either the test being resulted or other appropriatefile linked to the accession or result being entered.  This field should not be edited by site personnel.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>loinc method</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8188_6.html">8188.6</a></td><td></td><td>This is the LOINC Method which must be entered to capture a LOINC Code forthe test result.

If this field is null, the LOINC Methodwill be inherited from either the test being resulted or other appropriatefile linked to the accession or result being entered.  This field should not be edited by site personnel.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
