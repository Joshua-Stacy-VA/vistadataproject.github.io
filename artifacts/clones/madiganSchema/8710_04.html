When defining the upper  limit for infants less than one year old, enter the decimal number portionof the year. (For example, A baby 100 days old equals .273785 yr.)    If less than 6 decimal places are entered, always round the last digit to the next highest value. This will ensure that the age calculation for the patient will fall within the upper limit specified for the age group. Example:        An age group of 3 DAYS has an upper limit of 3/365.25 = .008213, expressedto 6 decimal places. If a 6 decimal place entry is made in the field, thenno rounding is necessary. If the upper limit entry is 5 decimal places,then enter .00822. Note that the 5th decimal place entry is rounded up eventhough the numeral in the 6th decimal place is less than 5. If the upperlimit entry is 4 decimal places, then enter .0083. Once again, note thatthe 4th decimal place entry is rounded up without regard to the numeral inthe 5th decimal place. Do not make entries having less than 4 decimalplaces, as the rounding process may cause the upper limit entry to changeby greater than 1 day. </td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>AGE GROUP</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the age group for a set of reference values.  It can bea general term such as ADULT, NEWBORN, CHILD, or a specific age range suchas 2-5 yrs.  If there is no specific age range, enter ALL.  This name isa label that prints on the display of Lab Test Information.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>REFERENCE LOW</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>Enter the lower limit of values for the particular test when performedon this type of specimen.  Any result lower than this entry will beflagged with an "L" whenever the results are displayed.Limit the length of any text used so it will fit into the report formats.Also keep in mind the alert flags defined in the Lab Test file forsets of codes.  Make sure the reference values and the alert flags definedin the set of codes match.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>REFERENCE HIGH</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>Enter the upper limit or value for the test performed on this type ofspecimen.  Any result higher than this entry will be flagged with an "H"whenever the results are displayed.  If the reference value is text,be sure the text length will fit on the report formats.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>PANIC LOW</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>Enter the low value for this test which designates a "panic value" or"life threatening" result which would need to be brought to the technologist's, supervisor's, physician's and/or ward personnel'sattention.  When a test value falls below the limit set here, the systemasks for a confirmation step during result entry.  When a result displaysthrough a reporting or inquiry option, the result is followed by a "L*".</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>PANIC HIGH</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>Enter the high value for this test which designates a "panic value"result needing confirmation or additional review before thecertification and release of the result to the physician.  All of theinformation about panic low holds true for panic high except that flagsoccur when the test result is higher than the limit set here.  Whenresults are reported or displayed, the result is followed by a "H*".</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div>
