The data is created when batches are generated both on thesubmitting laboratory and the performing laboratory.  This data is purgedby the nightly purge utility when the specified purge criteria are met.This file is designed and developed for the use of the Interoperabilityproject.  This file is maintained by the Interoperability software.DO NOT EDIT THE FILE ENTRIES. This file also contains a non-FileMan field on the ORDERED TEST multiplefield (sub-file 8719.05).  This non-FileMan field contains the INV arrayformatted by the GIS when the order/accession message is received.  It isused when the specimen is acknowledged and is deleted when the specimenis accessioned at the performing laboratory. ACCESSION NUMBER XREF:  Used to find which batch contains a specificaccession^LRS(8719,"AACN",ACCESSION POINTER,BATCH)=""    ACCESSION POINTER = pointer to Accession file (#66)    BATCH             = batch number - pointer to Shipping Batch file (#8719)          ACCESSION POOL XREF:  Used for creation of a shipping batch.  Entry iscreated when accession is added to the pool.  Entry is deleted when placed ona batch or when cancelled. ^LRS(8719,"APOOL",WORK ELEMENT,PERFORMING LAB,ACN POINTER)=""    WORK ELEMENT = submitting lab work element - pointer to Lab Work element                   file (#69.92)    PERFORMING LAB = performing lab - variable pointer (#4 / #8101.1)    ACN POINTER = pointer to Accession file (#66) ACKNOWLEDGED ACCESSIONS XREF:  Used for the acknowledgement of accessions atthe performing lab.  This cross reference will be built when the HL7 messagesare received and stored at the performing lab.
