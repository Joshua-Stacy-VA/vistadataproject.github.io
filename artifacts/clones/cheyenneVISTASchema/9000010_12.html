There will be one record for each typeof skin test given to a patient on a given visit.  Data must exist for apatient and a visit before data can be entered here.  The record isnormally created when a skin test is given, and the results, if available,are entered at a later date and matched to the original record.  Ifresults are entered and a skin test given does not exist, a new record iscreated. In the VA, If a CPT code is entered into PCE that represents a skin test,then a skin test entry will automatically be entered into the V Skin Testfile.  And vice versa, if a skin test is entered into PCE that representsa CPT code, then a CPT entry will automatically be entered into the V CPTfile.  This supports getting workload credit from clinical activities.The PCE Code Mapping file defines the relationships between Skin Tests andCPT codes.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>skin test(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9999999_28.html">9999999.28</a></td><td>B</td><td>This is the type of Skin Test that was given to the patient at theencounter.  </td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>patient name(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9000001.html">9000001</a></td><td></td><td>This is the patient who received the skin test.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>visit(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9000010.html">9000010</a></td><td>AD</td><td>This is the encounter defined in the Visit file that represents when andwhere the skin test was done.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>results</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>P:POSITIVE<br/>N:NEGATIVE<br/>D:DOUBTFUL<br/>O:NO TAKE<br/></td><td></td><td>This is the interpretation of skin test results.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>reading</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the induration in millimeters (mm).</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>date read</td><td>0;6</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date and time of the reading of the skin test.
