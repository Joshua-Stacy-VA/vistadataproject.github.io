After a specified time period duringwhich the image is not viewed, the image is deleted from the magneticserver but remains available upon request from the jukebox. It takesslightly longer to display from the jukebox, but if requested, it is movedback to the server until it is no longer being viewed.

Only objects with an object type of GROUP have the object groupfield defined.  These objects can be thought of as the 'parent' of a setof images.  Generally, instead of having their own abstract, objects ofthe GROUP type use the abstract of the first entry in their object groupmultiple.  Sometimes, text will be used in place of the GROUP abstract forspeed.  Methods for viewing a GROUP object generally allow viewing of allthe members of the group, either selectively or altogether.  A goodexample would be a set of thirty CT scan images.  Using the integratedview menu option, the tiled display of image abstracts would contain onlyone abstract for the group.  Selecting the group object for viewingprovides the user with a tiled display of the abstracts of the individualCT scan images.  The user can then identify individual images for fullresolution viewing.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>patient</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>AC</td><td>This field is a pointer to the VistA patient file (#2), and contains theDFN of the patient that the image or object belongs to.

This field is currently not inuse.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>short description</td><td>2;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows the user to store a brief, one line description with theimage or object record.

It is also permanently written on the upper left corner ofthe image to provide visible identification.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>long description</td><td>3;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This word processing field allows the user to describe the image atlength.  The user may only choose to append this long description onselected images - ones which are 'classic' or 'unusual' cases. It can beused to summarize a group of images which have been put together for aconference or consult.  It will be used in the future to a greater extent,as options for image capture independent of VistA package are provided.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>last access date</td><td>0;9</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date and time the image was last viewed or accessed. Each timean abstract or image is requested for viewing, this field is automaticallyset with the current date and time.  In conjunction with the appropriatesite parameter, this field is used for automatic file migration.  That is,when an image has not been accessed within the predefined time period, itwill be deleted from the magnetic server and will only be accessible fromthe optical disk jukebox.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>iq</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is set by various integrity checkers in the Imaging software.This field is set if an entry has questionable integrity.</td></tr><tr><td>13.5</td><td>dupe</td><td>0;12</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is to allow screening of images thathave duplicate instances in the archive fileand the image file.

A pointer to this object will be foundin the Object Group multiple of the parent GROUP object.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>procedure/exam date/time</td><td>2;5</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date/time of the procedure or the exam. It is obtained fromthe parent data file, i.e. the date/time of the X-ray exam, the MedicalProcedure, the time the Laboratory specimen was obtained from the patient,or the date/time of the Surgical procedure. This often is not the same asthe date/time the image was captured. In a long surgical procedure theimage capture time may be several hours later than the start of theoperation. When a lab specimen is collected from a patient, it may beseveral days before images are captured from the slide.  If images areinitially stored on an intermediate media such as X-ray film or video tape,the capture time can be long after the procedure time.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>parent data file#(+)</td><td>2;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2005_03.html">2005.03</a></td><td></td><td>The values of fields 16, 17, 18 and 63 are numbers.These numbers are internal entry numbers.

Which fieldcorresponds to which internal entry number is explained below.Together, the values of these fields establish a link backto the entry in the "parent" file, that holds the informationthat describes why the image was collected.The link to the "parent" information is brought about bythe combination of the values of fields 16, 17, and, 18, andoptionally also field 63.The value of field 16 is a number that indicates the internalentry number of the "parent file" in the VA-FileMan data dictionary.Common parent files are:   File    Name   ====    ====     3.9:  MAIL MESSAGE    63:    AUTOPSY (MICROSCOPIC)    63.02: ELECTRON MICROSCOPY    63.08: SURGICAL PATHOLOGY    63.09: CYTOLOGY    63.2:  AUTOPSY (GROSS)    74:    RADIOLOGY   130:    SURGERY   691:    ECHOCARDIOGRAM   691.1:  CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION   691.5:  ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY   694:    HEMATOLOGY   699:    ENDOSCOPY   699.5:  GENERIC MEDICINE  8925:    TIUThe records in each of these "parent" files contain a multiple that itemizesthe list of images that belong to that record.The field numbers and fixed indexes for those multiplesall have the number 2005.
