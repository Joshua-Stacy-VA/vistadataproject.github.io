Enter here the name, or abbreviation, of the collectionagency you're using.  This will be included in the comments which arestored.  For instance, if you enter "TransWorld" here, then the messagegenerated might look like:     <<01-Jun-97>>>  14-day review accomplished by TransWorld.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td># records per message</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter here the maximum number of records (bills) permitted per electronicmessage in a transmission.  If nothing is entered then 250 is presumed andno single message will contain more than 250 records.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>maximum number of xmit's</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>If, for instance, you have a contract to only transmit a specific numberof records then enter that number here.  For example, when Houstonoriginally started this process as a test project, only 1,500 new recordswere permitted in the original testing phase.  If you have an "open"contract, with no limitation, simply leave this field blank.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>look back days</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of days to look back for records to consider in thisprocess.  For example, if you enter 365, then an record which meets allthe other collections criteria defined must be at least one year old (365days) in order to be considered for transmission.  If nothing is enteredhere then a default of 90 days is presumed.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>last search date</td><td>0;7</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the last date which was searched by the collectionsprocess for new activity to be transmitted.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>earliest day to ever search</td><td>0;8</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the earliest date for which records should be searched andtransmitted.

When the auto-purge feature is used, arecord must be at least this old, based on transmission date, and not be"active" any longer.  All STATUS CHANGE records, for a primary record, arealso deleted with this process.  If nothing is entered here then 365 days(1 year) is presumed.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>purge last run date(+)</td><td>0;14</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>purge run thru date(+)</td><td>0;15</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>update dow</td><td>0;16</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the day(s) of the week that you'd like the statistical report tobe sent, via E-mail, seperated by any punctuation.

For a bill to be transmitted to thecollection agency it must be equal to, or exceed, the amount you enterhere.  If you enter zero, or leave the data element blank, all bills whichmeet all other search criteria AND have at least one penny due will betransmitted.  For example, if you wish to restrict the transmission ofbills to those with a principle amount due of at least $100 enter 100here.  Bills meeting all other search criteria with an amount due of0-$99.99 will be excluded from the collection process, using this example.</td></tr><tr><td>.19</td><td>mccr notification date (last)(+)</td><td>0;19</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.2</td><td>report mailgroup</td><td>0;20</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_8.html">3.8</a></td><td></td><td>For the collections process, enter the mail group that reports generatedinto e-mail messages should be delivered to.
