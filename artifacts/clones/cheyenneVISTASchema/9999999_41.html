These fields may point to other files and routines not deployed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Inclusion of these fields, as designed, was approved by the DBA.  These fields were initially introduced with the release of the VISTA IMMUNIZATION ENHANCEMENTS 1.0 (PX*1*201) for the VistA Immunization Enhancements Project.  Additional fields may be included in later enhancements.    This file contains the Immunization Manufacturers' LOT NUMBERS for the immunizations/vaccines administered in the VA.  The LOT NUMBERs themselvesmay not be unique, but the combination of LOT NUMBER and MANUFACTURERmust form a unique entry.  This file also relies on a nightly backgroundtask that checks the entries' EXPIRATION DATE field.  If the date is equalto that day's date, or has passed, that entry's STATUS is set to EXPIRED.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>lot number</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the lot number of a manufacturer's immunization/vaccine product.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>manufacturer(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9999999_04.html">9999999.04</a></td><td></td><td>This is the manufacturer using this lot number.
