The intent is to give facilities a means of schedulingPM inspections for a given device type (defibrillator, transformer,electrical generator, etc) without having to explicitly edit therecord of each individual piece of equipment. If the PM parameters in theEQUIPMENT file (File 6914) do not agree with the corresponding PM parametersin this file, the information in the EQUIPMENT file will take precedence.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>A category of devices that receive the same frequencies and typesof preventive maintenance inspections.</td></tr><tr><td>.5</td><td>synonym</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="6911_02.html">6911.02</a></td><td></td><td>A multiple field intended to allow for selection of Equipment Categoriesin more than one way.
