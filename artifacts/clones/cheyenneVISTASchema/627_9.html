Originally, this file wasnamed DSM-III-R MODIFIERS, had 36 entries, and was used exclusivelyfor DSM-III-R purposes.  When the DSM-IV software was created,this file was renamed, generically, to DSM MODIFIERS.   When the DSM-IV modifiers were released, the following was true:  1.  The 36 entries in the original DSM-III-R MODIFIERS file were      identical to the first 36 entries in the DSM-IV modifiers.  2.  Entries after 37, were not present in the      DSM-III-R MODIFIERS file; they were truly new, unique entries. When the DSM-IV modifiers were released the following changes were made to the file:  1.  The PROMPT field (#1) was changed from 200 to 230 characters  2.  The file name was changed as noted above  3.  The file description was changed.  4.  A new multiple field - DSM VERSION - was added to the DSM       MODIFIERS file.  It was assigned field number 4.  The purpose      of this field was to track the versions by which each modifier      entry was used.  (Therefore, the first 36 entries have two      entries in this multiple:  DSM-III-R and DSM-IV.  And, the entries      unique to DSM-IV, entries after 37, have one entry in the       multiple: DSM-IV.)</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the internal entry number of the record.
