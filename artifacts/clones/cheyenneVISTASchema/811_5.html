Terms have a number of uses,including as findings in a reminder definition, as finding rules forbuilding patient lists, and as elements of extract finding groups. This file contains a combination of national, local, and VISN levelterms. Nationally distributed entries will have a CLASS of "National"and the name is prefixed with "VA-". Any terms created at your siteshould have a CLASS of "Local". Terms created for VISN use will have aCLASS of "VISN"Before a term can be used, it must have findings mapped to it. Thefindings that can be mapped to a term are any of the standardClinical Reminder findings with the exception of terms.Reminder terms are useful for national reminders involving findingsthat are based on local file definitions (e.g., laboratory test, drugfile, radiology). National reminder terms have limited editingcapabilities, which allow sites to map their local finding items to aterm. Sites may create local reminder terms, providing an easy way togroup a variety of findings and treat them the same way in a reminder. When a reminder with terms is evaluated, the finding items mapped tothe term are used to find the patient data, but the patient data isreported based on the term the data is mapped to.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the term.
