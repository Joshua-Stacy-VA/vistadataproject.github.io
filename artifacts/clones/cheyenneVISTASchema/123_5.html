(e.g., Psychologymay be defined with its Service Usage blank, and its Sub-specialtymultiple defined with services of which some or all may be "TRACKINGONLY" services.  This hierarchy facilitates the situation when aservice, such as Psychology, prefers a common location for all relatedconsults to be sent to.
