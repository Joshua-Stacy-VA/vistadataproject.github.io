Each time a patient is transferredor admitted to a ward of one of these types, a patient assessmentinstrument must be completed (these are stored in the PAF file - #45.9).Additionally, twice a year, a census of nursing home and intermediatemedicine wards is taken and assessments are done at that time.  Once anassessment is completed, a patient is placed into one of the 17 RUG-IIgroups based on the level of care s/he is receiving.  The 17 RUG groupsare stored in this file along with the yearly WWUs (weighted work units)for each.  These weighted work units are supplied by MAS VACO and theBoston DPC (which supports the RUG-II program) and are used forreimbursement at the medical center level.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This number is created automatically by VA FileMan.
