An APPOINTMENT STATUS(#409.63) file entry can beassociated with one or more of these groups This relationship is definedby the ASSOOICATED GROUPS(#100) multiple of that APPOINTMENTSTATUS file. The SDAM APPT MGT (Appointment Management) option of the Schedulingpackage uses this association. In that option, the user is allowed toselect which 'group' of appointments to view. Appointments witha current status associated with that group are then displayed. If a group needs to be added/modified/deleted, a patch will beissued instructing the site how to make the change. Otherwise,this table file should not be edited in any way by the site.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name of the appointment group.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>title</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the free-text title for the group.

However, INPATIENT appointments can be inthe past and future.  The screen causes only appointments witha date/time of greater than today to be used.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
