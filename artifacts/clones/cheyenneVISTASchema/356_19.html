The first option will update the monthly and yearly totalsfields. The second option will search the CLAIMS TRACKING file forunbilled episodes of care and should be run on the 1st or second dayof the month. There are two user options which are available to regenerate thereports. The automatically queued options will not write overpreviously compiled data. The user queued options will write overpreviously compliled data. Sites who modify the data in this fileshould be aware that the user queued options will overwrite manualchanges. Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>month/year(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the Month and Year for this data.
