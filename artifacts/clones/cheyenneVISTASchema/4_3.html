The local domain is named.2.  The parent is named at the local site.3.  A script from the parent to the subordinate domain is created.4.

It should bea number sufficiently high so as to avoid purging messages which arein danger of being purged before they can be delivered.

Generally,a record of the last 20 purges is kept.MailMan has two ways to purge messages.  The option XMAUTOPURGE is generallyrun after XMCLEAN (the waste basket cleaner) and will purge any messagesthat are not pointed at by any recipients nor the sender.  The optionXMPURGE-BY-DATE can also be run to purge messages that have an originationdate older than one used to initiate the process.  It is recommended that before XMPURGE-BY-DATE is used, users be notified of the proposed purge date so they have a chance to preserve important texts.  These are the only options that actually kill off entries in the message file.  The XMPURGE option does the same thing as XMAUTOPURGE, but is meant to be run in foreground and displays data as it proceeds. Unlike XMPURGE and XMAUTOPURGE, which only remove messages that no one holds in their mail baskets any more, XMPURGE-BY-DATE will remove messages fromusers' mail baskets and then delete them from the message file (3.9).</td></tr><tr><td>4.303</td><td>automatic integrity check</td><td>.12;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:YES<br/>1:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>XMAUTOPURGE is generally run at least once a week at most sites.  It isthe process that purges messages that are no longer referenced.  Before itis run, XMCLEAN is generally run.  XMCLEAN removes messages from WASTEbaskets so that they will be unreferenced when XMAUTOPURGE comes along.XMAUTOPURGE kicks off the part of XMUTCHECKFILE that checks the Mail Boxfile.  XMUTCHECKFILE also resets and cleans up the  x-refs of this file.If your system has had fairly clean runs of XMUTCHECKFILE or if the entireXMUTCHECKFILE process is run regularly as a separate process, it is notnecessary for XMAUTOPURGE to run any part of it again.</td></tr><tr><td>4.304</td><td>weekday days to purge</td><td>NOTOPURGE;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>When the unreferenced messages purge runs, it purges messages fromthe message file, ^XMB(3.9, which are no longer referenced, meaningthey aren't in anyone's mailbox.If this field is null, OR if the purge is run on Saturday, the purgestarts at the beginning of the message file. If this field has a value, AND the purge is run on Sunday throughFriday, the purge starts at the message create date calculated bysubtracting the number of days from today's date.So, if this number is 45, the unreferenced message purge would startwith messages created 45 days ago, and work from there forward.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>show institution in mailman?</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>y:YES<br/>n:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field controls whether mailman will show the user's organizationafter his name.

If so, set this field to YES,and enter the approved sites in the AUTO-FORWARD APPROVED SITE multiple.For VA sites, this field must be set to YES.  The only approved sites arethose ending in ".VA.GOV".If this field is set to YES, MailMan will limit auto-forwarding to onlythose sites whose names are in (or end in the ones in) the AUTO-FORWARDAPPROVED SITE multiple.</td></tr><tr><td>31.1</td><td>auto-forward approved site</td><td>3.1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4_33.html">4.33</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31.2</td><td>auto-forward waiver site</td><td>3.2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4_34.html">4.34</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>prevent message relay?</td><td>4;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer YES if you want to prevent outside sites from sending mail throughyour site to other outside sites.  Spammers and Virus propagators use thistechnique to disguise the source of their mail, and to make it appear tocome from a trusted source, namely your site.Answer NO if you want your site to act as a relay site for anyone.It is strongly recommended that you answer YES to prevent your site fromunwittingly relaying destructive mail.If you answer YES, you should define your "inside" sites in the MY DOMAIN(field #41) multiple, so that MailMan can distinguish them from outsidesites.Note: This does NOT prevent users from receiving mail from outside sites.It also does NOT prevent users from forwarding mail to outside sites.Such actions are perfectly acceptable.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>my domains</td><td>4.1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4_341.html">4.341</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>limited broadcast</td><td>5;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4_32.html">4.32</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>limited broadcast default</td><td>0;20</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>When sending a limited broadcast message, this is the default which willappear when the user is presented with limited broadcast choices. If you don't want a default to appear, delete this entry.</td></tr><tr><td>142</td><td>no-purge days buffer (local)</td><td>.14;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used during the un-referenced-messages purge to avoidpurging the last few messages in the message file, according totheir local create date. We subtract the NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL) from today's date, givinga 'no-purge date'.  Local messages which were created on or after thatdate and which were sent to remote sites are not subject to purge.Other messages are not affected by this buffer.If this field is not filled in, it defaults to 7 days.  This is therecommended value.It should not be less than the NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (field 4.301)or it will have no effect.One situation in which this buffer may be useful is in the case of amessage sent only to a remote site.  Such a message is unreferencedand would otherwise be subject to purge.  If a reply came from theremote site after the original message had been purged, the senderwould have access only to the reply and not to the original message.The NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL) could be set to a reasonable numberof days to allow for a reply.</td></tr><tr><td>143</td><td>fax enabled</td><td>0;19</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:no<br/>1:yes<br/></td><td></td><td>Your site is fax enabled if you have the suite of fax software and files(^AKF) and fax capability and you choose to allow faxes to be sent via MailMan.To send faxes via MailMan, Mail groups (file 3.8) must first be populated in thefax recipient and fax group multiples.  Then, when a user sends a message to amail group, the message is also faxed to any fax recipients in that mail group.Responses to the message are not faxed.</td></tr><tr><td>217</td><td>default institution(+)</td><td>XUS;17</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>This field is the default institution that is shown for any user whohasn't chosen one under "edit user options"</td></tr><tr><td>241</td><td>background message deliverers</td><td>6;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used by the background filer to determine how many messagedelivery queues (and tasks) there should be and how to separate them.</td></tr><tr><td>242</td><td>background response deliverers</td><td>6;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used by the background filer to determine how many responsedelivery queues (and tasks) there will be and how to separate them.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
