This file is used by DSS, Inc to interface the Dentalpackage to the DSS Dental-GUI.  The linkage here allows the creating ofDental Activity (file 221) records by selecting CPT codes.  The ICD codesare used by the DSS-GUI to enable the creation of workload from the GUI. This file is controlled by VA Dental Central Office.  It should not bemodified except through use of the Dental DRM GUI. Supported DBA Integration Agreements2815 - allows for pointers to the CPT file (#81)10082 - allows for pointers to the DIAGNOSIS file (#80)        allows for direct global reads of entire zeroth node</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>ada code(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="81.html">81</a></td><td></td><td>This is a subset of the CPT codes that are used by dental service.

For example, some procedures may coverseveral visits and the procedure is not marked as complete until the finalvisit.  In this case, then the default action for the DSS gui is to notfile the procedure with DAS.
