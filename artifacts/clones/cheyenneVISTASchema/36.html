There are four ways this datais used in the transmission process.    1.  If nothing is entered then the default value assigned in the       "Parameter Enter/Edit" (AJK1UB PARAMETER ENTER/EDIT) is used       to screen bills.  Only bills equal to, or exceeding, the amount       entered using that option are considered for transmission.    2.  An asterisk can be entered in this field to indicate that, under       no circumstances, should a bill from this particular insurance       company every be transmitted to a collection agency, regardless       of value.    3.  A whole dollar amount can be entered indicating that only bills       with a principle amount due equal to, or greater than, that dollar       amount will be included in the transmission process.  This over       rides the value assigned using the "parameter" option which is       system-wide.    4.  One can also enter dollars and cents which is processed the same       as described in 3, above.  The format is $$$$$.cc where any number       of dollars is permitted, up to $99,999 and the two cents must be       entered.  Punctuation, other than the decimal separating dollars       and cents is not permitted and the total field length allowed is       eight (8) characters.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
