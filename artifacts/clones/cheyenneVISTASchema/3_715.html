The filter is used by MailManto determine into which basket to place a message.  Messages can befiltered based on up to three criteria which must all be true: - Subject contains - Message is from - Message is toFor example, if you specify 'subject contains' and 'message is from', thefilter takes effect only if the subject contains the string you specify ANDthe message is from the person you specify. If you wish the filter to take effect upon 'subject contains' OR 'messageis from' you must create two filters, one with 'subject contains', and theother with 'message is from'.Filtering takes place during message delivery and can also be selected as abasket action.  The filter is ignored during delivery under the followingconditions: - The message already exists in one of your baskets. - The message is from you, and you specified a basket (other than the INbasket) at the transmit prompt. - The sender has specified a delivery basket and you have allowed it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>order(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the order in which you wish to have your filters checked.A message may match several filters, depending on the conditions you haveset.  It is here that you specify relative filter priority.  If severalfilters have the same order, then the first one you entered receivespriority.If you aren't sure, enter 100.  You can always change it later.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>basket(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>C</td><td>This is the basket you want any messages to go into if they match all ofthe conditions you specify for this filter.The basket may not be the "IN" basket, because that is the default basket.The basket must exist (or be created) at the time you specify it.  You maydelete this basket later.  If a message filters to this basket, and thebasket does not exist, the basket will be created.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>status(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:OFF<br/>1:ON<br/></td><td></td><td>If the filter is active, it will be used.If the filter is not active, it will be ignored.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>subject contains</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the subject contains the string you specify AND if the message matchesthe other conditions (if any), then the message matches this filter.The subject is capitalized automatically to facilitate filtering.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>from</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the person who sent the message. If it's a local person, just enter the name. If it's a remote person, enter name@site.  MailMan will match any senderwhose name contains 'name' and whose site contains 'site'.  'Name' maybe null, in which case, MailMan will match any sender whose sitecontains 'site'.  'Site' may be null, in which case, MailMan will matchany sender whose name contains 'name'.  In any event, the string must befrom 2 to 45 characters and must contain '@'. If it's a local message from a VISTA package/fake sender,put '@' at the end, like ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE@ The sender's name is capitalized automatically to facilitate filtering. For this filter to activate, its STATUS must be on, this condition andthe other conditions (if any) must match the message, and it must be thefirst filter (as controlled by its ORDER) to match the message.Finally, filtering must be turned on.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>addressed to</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the person or group to whom the message is addressed.If the person is remote, enter name@site.  MailMan will match anysender whose name contains 'name' and whose site contains 'site'.'name' or 'site' may be null.The addressee's name may be automatically capitalized to facilitatefiltering.MailMan will check the addressees that you see when you Query (Q) themessage.  MailMan will NOT check the expanded list of addresses thatyou see when you Query Detailed (QD) the message.For this filter to activate, its STATUS must be on, this condition and theother conditions (if any) must match the message, and it must be the firstfilter (as controlled by its ORDER) to match the message.  Finally,filtering must be turned on. </td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>vaporize days</td><td>0;8</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The message will be set to vaporize (be deleted from your mailbox) thismany days after it is delivered to you.  This date will override anyvaporize date set by the sender. You will be able to change or deletethe vaporize date at the message action prompt whenever you read themessage.  If this field is null, the filter will not set any vaporize date. This will only apply to new messages and responses which are put intoyour mailbox (includes moving from the WASTE basket) as a result ofdelivery or latering.  It won't apply to messages which are already inyour mailbox.  It won't apply when you filter messages which are alreadyin your mailbox. </td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>deliver new?</td><td>0;9</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>If you don't answer, or delete the answer, the default is YES. YES means that the message will be delivered as usual, and made new asusual. NO means that the message will be delivered as usual, but it won't bemade new, so you won't know it's arrived unless you check.  This will only apply to new messages which you have not seen before.It won't apply to responses or forwarded messages with responses.  Itwon't apply when you filter messages which are already in your mailbox. </td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>forward to</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="3_7159.html">3.7159</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
