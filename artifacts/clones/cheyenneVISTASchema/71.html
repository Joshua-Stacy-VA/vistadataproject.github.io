The entries in this file are the allowable choices the userwill be able to pick from at the procedure prompt. This prompt appears aspart of the 'Register', 'Case No. Edit' and the 'Exam Status Tracking'functions of the module. If the procedure has an inactivation date less than the current datethen the procedure is not a valid choice and will not appear on thelist of valid/active procedures when displayed to the user. Once this software is in production, you should never delete any entries.Entries can be deactivated by entering an 'inactivation' date for theentry. Adding new entries is always allowed.   Data Storage ------------The data for the 'RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURES' file is stored in the ^RAMIS(71,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates --------------- The following is a list of input templates used by the package and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:  Name                 Routine            Description; Option(s)                     Compiled ____                ________            ____________ RA PROCEDURE EDIT             Use to enter/edit procedure to the file; If any modifications to this input template are needed for localpurposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logicin the template.  Print Templates --------------- The following is a list of print templates used by the package:  Name                         Description; Option(s) ____                         ______________________ RA ALPHA LIST OF ACTIVES     Prints a listing of procedures and used with                              the ALPHA LIST OF ACTIVES sort template to                              list only 'active' procedures;                              RA ALPHALIST  RA PROCEDURE LIST            Prints a 'long' listing of procedures;                              RA PROCLONG, RA INACPRCLONG, RA PROCSERIES  RA PROCEDURE SHORT LIST      Prints a 'short' listing of procedures;                              RA PROCSHORT, RA INACPRCSHORT  Sort Templates -------------- The following is a list of sort templates used by the package:  Name                         Related Print Template ----                         ---------------------- RA ALPHA LIST OF ACTIVES     ALPHA LIST OF ACTIVES  RA PROCEDURES BY             PROCEDURE LIST AMIS CODES  RA SERIES ONLY               PROCEDURE LIST  The modification of any sort templates is not recommended.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA;GMTS;PXRM</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name (3-60 characters) of this rad/nuc medprocedure.

If theexam status set-up for the affected imaging types specifies thatradiopharmaceutical data should be asked and/or required to progress tovarious statuses, this field can be used to over-ride that requirement. Available categories are defined as follows:     0 or blank - Always ask for Radiopharmaceutical if and when exam        status parameters specify (this is the default).     1 - Suppress the radiopharmaceutical prompts.  Never ask or require        Radiopharmaceutical even if exam status parameters specify that a        Radiopharmaceutical should be entered. Even if default        Radiopharmaceuticals are entered for the procedure they will not        be automatically entered on the exam record by the system when the        case is registered.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>required flash card printer</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains the name (1-20 characters) of the location where theflash cards for this procedure are to be printed.

'Series' is used whenthere is more than one AMIS code associated with this exam procedure.'Parent' procedures should be used to pre-define a group of procedures(descendents).  When a procedure is marked as a 'Parent', the system willask for its 'descendents' (other procedures in this file that are part ofthe procedure group). During the 'Register an Exam' option, these'descendent' procedures will be registered as a set under one examdate/time.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>staff review required</td><td>0;7</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field contains a 'Yes' or 'No' value to indicate if this procedurerequires an interpreting staff physician's review of the interpretingresident's report results.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>original procedure?</td><td>0;8</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field contains a 'Yes' or 'No' value which indicates if thisprocedure is from the original group of 535 procedures sent with thissystem or if this procedure has been set up by the site.
