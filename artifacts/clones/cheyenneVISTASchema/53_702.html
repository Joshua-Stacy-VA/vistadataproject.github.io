All order numbers are numbersappended with a unique type identifier.  The expected formats include:   nP : a 'P' indicates that the order is PENDING action by Pharmacy       Service.  (Given that the BCMA Backup System is designed to be       real-time, pending orders are transmitted and stored on the       BCMA Backup System workstation.   nU : a 'U' indicates that the order is for a UNIT DOSE medication.   nV : a 'V' indicates that the order is for INTRAVENOUS medication --       that is, IV solutions and additives. Order numbers are filed in this file with their respective alphacharacters because unit dose and IV orders could have the same numericportion of an order number. It also should be noted that 'P'ENDING order numbers are completelyreplaced once the order has been processed by Pharmacy on the VistAserver.  Once Pharmacy processes the order, an actual order number(that is, one with either a 'U' or a 'V' appended to it) is generatedand filed on the workstation.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>cprs order number</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>ACPRS</td><td>This field contains the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) ordernumber associated with this Pharmacy order.  This field is of particularimportance in the case of 'P'ending orders.  Whenever an order isprocessed into a patient's BCMA Backup System record a check is madewhether the CPRS order is already on file, and further whether thatorder on file is 'P'ending.  If so, the 'P'ending order record isdeleted and replaced by the data transmitted in the new HL7 message.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>order status</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Order status is filed exactly as transmitted from Pharmacy via the HL7message.
