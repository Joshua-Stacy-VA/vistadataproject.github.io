If this date/time is in thefuture, this event may continue to be selected for delaying orders untilthis time passes.</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>activation history</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="100_52.html">100.52</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>type of event(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>A:ADMISSION<br/>T:TRANSFER<br/>D:DISCHARGE<br/>O:O.R.<br/>M:MANUAL RELEASE<br/></td><td>ADT</td><td>This is the event that should cause delayed orders to be released to theservice(s) for action; for OR (Surgery) events, the orders will bereleased when TIME PAT IN OR (#130,.205) is entered in the Surgerypackage.   Orders delayed for Manual Release will not be automaticallyreleased by CPRS at all and can only be released via the "Release toService" action by a user who is authorized to do so.  Authorization iscontrolled by the parameter OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL, which letssites choose whether release is controlled by keys or by the parameterOREVNT MANUAL RELEASE or both.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>division(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>This is the division that this event will apply to; for transfers acrossdivisions, this should be the new division that the patient is going to.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>event order dialog</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="101_41.html">101.41</a></td><td></td><td>This should be the dialog for a generic order requesting this event; ifsuch an order is not necessary for this event, leave this empty.  Unlikeother delayed orders, the order created by this dialog will becomeactive right away when signed and be visible on the Active Orders viewas well as with the delayed orders on the Orders tab.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>order set/menu</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="101_41.html">101.41</a></td><td></td><td>This is a menu or order set containing items that are either necessaryor commonly ordered when this event occurs.  It will be invoked rightaway when first placing delayed orders for this event; if an EVENT ORDERDIALOG was defined for this event, this order set will be presented to theuser immediately following that dialog.  You may enter any type of orderdialog except prompt types.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>lapse in #days</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of days to allow orders for this event to remaindelayed for a patient.  Patient Events are evaluated whenever delayedorders are acted upon or viewed, and if this number of days has passedsince delayed orders were entered for this event for the patient thenthe status of all orders delayed for this event will be changed to"lapsed" and the Patient Event itself will be terminated.  The orderscan no longer be released to the service then.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>mas movement type</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="405_2.html">405.2</a></td><td></td><td>This is an MAS Movement Type that can further define this event; it isoptional, but if defined then it must match the patient's movement datato satisfy the event and cause any delayed orders to be released.  Forexample, to have delayed orders released when a patient returns frompass enter the movement type of AUTH ABSENCE 96 HOURS OR LESS, or leavethis field empty to have the transfer event defined by other criteriasuch as treating specialty or ward location.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>display text(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is the name of the event as it will appear to the user inCPRS.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>ordering parameters location</td><td>0;9</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44.html">44</a></td><td></td><td>Many order dialogs use parameters that depend on location; this fieldwill be used as the default location for retrieving those parametervalues when delaying orders to this event.  The patient's actuallocation will be saved with the order at the time of its release.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>included treating specialties</td><td>TS;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="100_51.html">100.51</a></td><td></td><td>These are treating specialties that can satisfy this event; if thepatient's new specialty matches one in this list then orders delayedfor this event may be released.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>included locations</td><td>LOC;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="100_511.html">100.511</a></td><td></td><td>These are ward locations that can satisfy this event; if the patient's newlocation matches one in this list then orders delayed for this event maybe released.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>edit history</td><td>9;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="100_512.html">100.512</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>copy active orders</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field determines whether or not the user will be presented with the patient's active orders, which may then be copied to the delayed event being created. If this field is set to no then the user will not see the patient's active orders and will not be allowed to copy any current orders. If this field is set to yes then the user will be shown the patient's active orders and the user may select orders to be copied to the delayed event.  The list of active orders will be presented to the user after the ORDER DIALOG for the release event is processed (if it exists) and before the ORDER SET/MENU for the release event is processed (if it exists).</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>parent</td><td>0;12</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="100_5.html">100.5</a></td><td>DAD</td><td>For release events that have a common trigger event (e.g. sametreating specialty or same locations) but require different namesor display text a parent-child relationship can be set up.  The parentcontains the base trigger event logic while the child contains theinformation unique to this event.  In a sense, the child events are"synonyms" to the parent event as all childen are related to the parent.When the trigger event occurs that would release orders for the parentall the child orders related to that parent are also released.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
