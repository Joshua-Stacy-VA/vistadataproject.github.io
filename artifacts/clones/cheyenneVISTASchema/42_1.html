When initializing your ADTsystem it is important that you review these admission types anddetermine which types are to be used by your facility by setting theACTIVE field to '0' if not used at your facility or '1' if used.The information in this file is planned to be incorporated into theFACILITY MOVEMENT file in a future release.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>active</td><td>0;3</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>movement type</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="43_9.html">43.9</a></td><td>AM</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>point to mas movement type</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="405_2.html">405.2</a></td><td></td><td>This field is being provided prior to version 5.0 to allow entry of thenew MAS MOVEMENT TYPE file pointer.  Prior to version 5.0, the MOVEMENTTYPE (as defined in field .06 of this file) was a pointer to file 43.9(the MOVEMENT TYPE file).  It will now be a pointer to file 405.2 (theMAS MOVEMENT TYPE file).  There are several additional entries in thisnew file, so you may wish to consider changing your present movementtype pointer for version 5.0. Do not change the pointer in the .06 field.  No changes should be madeprior to version 5.0.  However, upon installation of version 5.0, ifyou would like to utilize one of the new movement types, enter that typehere.  If there is nothing entered in this field, the conversion processwill assume that you would like to leave the admission type unchanged. For example, AMBULATORY CARE (OPT-AC) is a new admission type.  If youhave a local admission type of OPT-AC, you may wish to point to this newadmission type rather than the one you had previously chosen.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>print name</td><td>0;8</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter an abbreviated name for this movement type.  It will appear onextended patient inquiry, extended bed control, and other options.  Ifnothing is entered here, an extract of the first 20 characters of thefull name will appear on these outputs which may not properly reflectthe uniqueness of a movement.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><h2>Referenced by 1 types</h2><ol><li><a href="45_1.html">SOURCE OF ADMISSION</a> (45.1) -- admit type</li></ol></div>
