Let's consider a fairly complex example: an item subjectto MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, and ANNUAL PM inspections. If STARTING MONTH wereset to FEB; an ANNUAL inspection would be scheduled in FEB; QUARTERLYinspections in MAY, AUG, and NOV; and MONTHLY inspections in MAR, APR,JUN, JUL, SEP, OCT, DEC, and JAN.  If STARTING MONTH is left blank, JAN will be assumed.</td></tr><tr><td>2.6</td><td>skip months</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td> A range of months (inclusive) during which PMI's are to be suspended.For example, an entry of 'NOV-MAR' for an air-conditioner would suppressthe scheduling of any PMI's in NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB, and MAR. Some care needs to be taken when using this field. If you want an ANNUALinspecton, for instance, be sure that the STARTING MONTH is not withinthe range specified by the SKIP MONTHS; otherwise the ANNUAL PMI willnever be scheduled. Entries must take the form 'MMM-NNN', where MMM is a three characterabbreviation of the first month for which PMiI's are to be suspended andNNN is a three character abbreviation for the last month for which PMI'sare to be suspended. Valid abbreviations are: JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, and DEC.</td></tr><tr><td>2.7</td><td>criticality</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>An index of the importance of performing PMI's on this device. Enter aninteger between 1 and some upper limit not greater than 99 (most sites use10 or 20). The closer the values are to the upper limit the more criticalthe PMI's become. A value of 1 would indicate that PMI's are desireablebut far from essential (least critical). When PM worklists are generated, the system will ask if all devicesshould be included or just those whose CRITICALITY is within a certainuser selectable range (say, 7 to 10). This is intended as a means ofadjusting workload to match available resources. Use of this feature is left entirely to the discretion of each site. If aCRITICALITY range is selected, the system will ask the user whetherdevices having no CRITICALITY should be included or excluded.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>frequency</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="6914_43.html">6914.43</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><div class='error'><p>Error: Invalid Global File Type: 6914.04</p></div></div>
