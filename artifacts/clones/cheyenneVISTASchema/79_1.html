The parameter switches allow the 'customizing' of the modulefor each location by the package coordinator. Within an imaging division there may be a number of physical locationswhere a imaging procedure can be performed.  The module is designed tohandle multiple locations within a division.  However, each location canonly be associated with one division. These parameters are loaded into the user's partition once the moduledetermines which division and location the user is currentlyassociated with.  This is determined by one of two ways: 1) the devicethe user is using is an entry in the 'INPUT DEVICES' sub-file fora location or 2) if (1) is not true than the module will simplyask the user what his/her current location is. Entries in this file should not be deleted.  Adding new entries is alwaysallowed.  Data Storage ------------The data for the 'IMAGING LOCATIONS' file is stored in the ^RA(79.1,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates ---------------The following is a list of input templates used by the packageand the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:                      Compiled Name                Routine      Description; Option(s) ----                -------     ----------------------- RA LOCATION PARAMETERS          Used to enter/edit location parameters                                 that are controlled by the package                                 coordinator;                                 RA SYSLOC  RA SITE MANAGER                 Used to enter/edit location parameters                                 that are controlled by IRM;                                 RA DEVICE If any modifications to these input templates are needed for localpurposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logicin the template.  Print Templates --------------- The following is a list of print templates used by the package:  Name                  Description; Option(s) ----                  ---------------------- RA IMAGE LOC LIST     Print the location parameters for the entries in                       this file;                       RA SYSLOCLIST  RA EXAM ROOM LIST     Prints a list of cameras/equip/rms                       and the locations                       associated with the camera/equip/rm;                       RA SYSEXLIST  Sort Templates -------------- The following is a list of sort templates used by the package:  Name                  Related Print Template ----                  ---------------------- RA IMAGE LOC LIST     RA IMAGE LOC LIST  RA EXAM ROOM LIST     RA EXAM ROOM LIST  The modification of any sort templates is not recommended.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>location(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44.html">44</a></td><td>B</td><td>This field points to the Hospital Location File, and contains the name ofthis location.  The Hospital Location pointed to should be a COUNT clinic,with a type of 'CLINIC', and should be a clinic that prohibits makingappointments or creating appointment patterns.  The Stop Code of theclinic in file #44 should be a valid imaging stop code (i.e. an entry infile #71.5) and should match the DSS ID field #22 of the Imaging Locationin file #79.1.  The Institution of this clinic in file #44 should matchthe Rad/Nuc Med Division to which this Imaging Location is assigned. Coordination with MAS personnel is necessary to add locations to theHospital Location file.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>how many flash cards per visit</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This imaging 'locations' parameter is used to set up the number of flashcards to print per patient visit.

If this field is filled in, the systemautomatically fills in the proper imaging type on the registration record. Assigning an new imaging type (i.e. one not previously selected for anyother location) implies that procedures of the new imaging type areperformed under a separate service or section at your site, and separateworkload report is desired. For instance, at some sites Ultrasound may bedone separately from Radiology, and it would be appropriate to assign the'Ultrasound' imaging type to one or more locations.  Once the 'Ultrasound'imaging type is "activated" in this way, and procedures designated as'Ultrasound' imaging type have been registered, the system will reportUltrasound workload separately from Radiology workload. NOTE:  The 'Cardiology Studies' imaging type should NOT be assigned to alocation unless nuclear cardiology studies are done under a service otherthan Nuclear Medicine.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>default flash card format</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="78_2.html">78.2</a></td><td></td><td>This 'locations' parameter can contain the default format (from the 'FlashCards Formats' file) to be used when queueing a flash card to print.
