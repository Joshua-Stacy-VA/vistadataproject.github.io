If the value is 10, then apatient will be eligible for extract if their appointmentis within 10 days of the extract date. For the Non-Verified Insurance extract (#3), this indicateshow far in the past a patient must have been seen to beeligible for extract.  If the value is 10, then a patientwill be eligible for extract if they were seen in the last10 days.  </td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>selection criteria #2</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is a parameter that is used by the Non-Verified Insurance extract to determine whether a record should be extractedor not.  For the Non-Verified Insurance extract, this is similar to theFRESHNESS DAYS parameter in that this represents how long to waitbefore eIV can attempt to re-verify the same insurance for thatpatient.  If the value is 10, this means that eIV can attempt to re-verifyinsurance for a patient 11 days after the most recently inquireddate.  A specific date is always asked of the payer when trying todetermine patient's eligibility.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>maximum extract number(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows a site to restrict the daily number of recordsextracted and placed in the eIV Transmission Queue.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>suppress buffer creation</td><td>0;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:No<br/>1:Yes<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag will suppress the creation of Insurance Buffer entries when attempting to create insurance inquiries during the eIVprocess.  If the insurance inquiry cannot be transmitted becausethe insurance company does not resolve to a valid and eligiblepayer, this flag will not allow an Insurance Buffer entry to becreated and flagged to be corrected manually before being sentout.  This is intended to reduce the number of Insurance Bufferentries to be resolved manually which did not originate in theBuffer originally.  Please note that this flag only applies to the Appointment(Pre-Reg) extract and the Non-verified extract.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
