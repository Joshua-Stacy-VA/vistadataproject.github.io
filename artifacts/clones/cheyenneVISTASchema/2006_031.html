Ittracks the status of queue processing.  The Background Processor uses three files:              1. Queue   (2006.03)              2. Queue Pointer   (2006.031)              3. Jukebox  (2006.032) There are five different tasks that can be performed by the backgroundprocessor: 1. ABSTRACT -- create a small version of an image 2. EXPORT ---- copy an image to an export directory so that it can be usedoutside the imaging system 3. IMPORT ----copy an image from an import directory into the imaging system 4. JUKEBOX ---copy an image from hard disk to the jukebox 5. JBTOHD ----copy an image from the jukebox to the hard disk There is a single Input Queue file for all the requests, with across-reference to request type.  The background processor processes theentries in a prioritized first-in first-out fashion, and uses the QueuePointer file to record its progress. The background processor uses theJukebox file for device-specific information.  The jukebox platters arelogically placed into the Network Location file, and are pointed to by theJukebox file and the Image file.  Jukeboxes, which can be configured as asingle volume, only have a single entry in the network location file.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>MAG</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>queue name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Name of the queue holding the entry.
