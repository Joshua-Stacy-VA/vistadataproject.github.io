A study in this status is not accessible until VistA Imaging returns a status of Complete or Error and logs any errors encountered in the submission process. 2: Error                                                               This transaction has encountered an error while being submitted to VistA Imaging.  The error may be due to the TIU note creation or a problem with the attachments sent to the VistA Imaging server. Error messages are logged with the transaction and can be reviewed by users when opening the transaction in an error status. 3: Complete                                                             This transaction has completed the process and has successfully created a TIU note for interpretation on the selected Consult and if any attachments were included they have been successfully copied to the VistA Imaging server. 4: Ready to Complete                                                    This transaction has been checked in and alternatively, if submitted to a bi-directional instrument, has received the data back from the instrument.  Users may open these transactions and view the Consult/Procedure order as well as assign instrument results to the study.  Once these steps have been done this study can be submitted to VistA Imaging. 5: Pending Instrument Data                                             This transaction has been submitted to a bi-directional instrument and is awaiting that instrument to return the results of the procedure.  Transactions in this status should not be opened until the instrument has returned the results, assigned them to the study, and marked it as Ready to Complete.                                                                      6: CancelledThis transaction has been cancelled when the procedure request inConsult Report Tracking and CPRS has been cancelled or discontinued.</td></tr><tr><td>.091</td><td>error messages</td><td>.091;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="702_091.html">702.091</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple contains the information on the error messagesthat Clinical Procedures receive from API calls with Consults,TIU, CPRS, and VistA Imaging.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>image</td><td>.1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="702_1.html">702.1</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple contains the image attachment information for thetransaction.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>submitted to instrument</td><td>0;11</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="702_09.html">702.09</a></td><td>AINST</td><td>Points to the instrument definition that this study was submittedto at the time of check-in.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>instrument order number</td><td>0;12</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>AION</td><td>Contains the unique order number for this study that is sent to theinstrument if it is bi-directional so the results can be auto-matchedback to this study by the CP Gateway.Field is 1-22 characters and contains only numeric characters.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>visit</td><td>1;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9000010.html">9000010</a></td><td>AVISIT</td><td>This is the Visit entry returned from PCE.(Reference IA# 1902)</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>scheduled date/time</td><td>3;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>ASD</td><td>This field contains the date/time when the HL7 messageshould be sent by CP to the device for this CP transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>.3</td><td>conversion id reference</td><td>2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>ACONV</td><td>This field is the Reference Conversion ID.
