Thealpha characters identify the underlying frequency, such as'A' for monthly, 'K' for 8 times per year, etc.  The numbersplace the prediction pattern in the proper sequence withinits frequency type according to months, days, number ofvolumes, etc., according to a predetermined format for thePREDICTION PATTERN NAME.  This file and all its accompanyingfields are available for editing only under the NationalLibrary Files Maintenance option on FORUM.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>month</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows the input of the month or months involvedin the construction of the specific prediction pattern.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>wom/dow</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is to create a pattern for those serials titles whichare issued on a certain day of the week for a certain week ofthe month, for example, Friday of the third week.  This field canhandle more than one week;  for example, you could have a titleissued the first and third Fridays; the notation would be 1/5,3/5.  Days of the week are indicated by 0=Sunday through 6=Saturday.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>days added</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is used when a serials title is ussed every so manydays, for instance, every 21 days.  In such a case, the valueof 21 would be placed in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>volume increment</td><td>2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field allows the volume field to be incremented atthe month designated by the CHANGE MONTH field.  If thevolume number increases by 1 at each CHANGE MONTH, the valuein this field should be +1.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>issue change</td><td>2;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field will be used on all computed JOURNAL DATES other thanthe first JOURNAL DATE during the CHANGE MONTH.  The issue shouldbe incremented by the amount stated in this field if the entry hasa '+' as the first character.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>change month</td><td>2;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is for the input of the months at which thevolume numbers increase, the values input from 1 to 12.For instance, if a monthly serials title has two volumesper year, changing in January and July, the CHANGE MONTHvalue should be:  1,7.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>day-of-month</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If a serials title is always dated with a specific dayof the month, that day whould be entered here.  More thanone day can be entered.  A serials title which is alwaysissued and dated on the third and fifteenth would have thevalue of:  3,15.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>prediction pattern description</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a word-processing field to fully describe thepattern established with the fields in this file inplain English.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>issue increment</td><td>2;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field will be used on the first computed JOURNAL DATE during theCHANGE MONTH.  The ISSUE will be set to the number in this field ifthe number does not start with a '+";  otherwise add the number to thelast ISSUE.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>prediction pattern name</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>C</td><td>This field allows the creator of the prediction pattern togive the pattern a name following a set of conventionsdesigned by the Togus editors of the Prediction Pattern File.Pattern names include (1) the number of times per time periodthat the serials is issued, (2) the number of volumes per year,(3) the months when the volumes start, and (4) whether theissues reset to 1 when the volume number changes or not.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
