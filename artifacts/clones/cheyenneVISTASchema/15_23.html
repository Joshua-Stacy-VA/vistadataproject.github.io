There mayalso be merges of related files which require special processing (asindicated by entries within the 'Affects Merge' multiple of the packagefile).  This entry indicates which file merge the associated data isrelated to.  The entry is a file number for which a merge is being run.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>start date/time(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>The date and time at which the merge process actually began.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>status</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>A:ACTIVE<br/>C:COMPLETED<br/>U:UNKNOWN-LOST<br/>R:RESCHEDULED<br/>S:SCHEDULED<br/>H:HALTED<br/>E:ERROR EXIT<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to track the current status of the merge process.

The merge process goes through three stages, butsince the first is rapid and doesn't require any effort to repeat(since the entries have already been merged) only two stages are recorded.The FASTER (or EARLY) stage indicates the processing of pointers whicheither DINUMmed or cross-referenced so that they can be identifiedrapidly.  The LATTER stage indicates the processing of pointers whichcan only be found by stepping through each entry within a file - theseare the pointers which require longer periods to sucessfully completethe re-pointing.</td></tr><tr><td>1.03</td><td>file - current</td><td>1;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This value indicates the file currently being processed as recorded atthe last checkpoint by the active merge process.</td></tr><tr><td>1.04</td><td>entry-current</td><td>1;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This value indicates the last internal entry number recorded as acheckpoint (within the checkpointed file) by the active merge process.This value (in conjunction with the other checkpoint data) is intended foruse in tracking the progress of the merge process and, if necessary, topermit the merge process to be restarted in the vicinity where it was lastprocessing.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>file for thread</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="15_232.html">15.232</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
