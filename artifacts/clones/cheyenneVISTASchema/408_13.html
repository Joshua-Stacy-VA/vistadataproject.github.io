The name should be enteredin the same format as that for the veteran:  LASTNAME,FIRSTNAME MIDDLENAME.If a space is entered between the comma and the first name, it willautomatically be removed.  The relation's full name should be used to avoidpotential duplicates.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>sex(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>M:MALE<br/>F:FEMALE<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter the sex of the relative.

This information isnecessary for use in the income screening and means test portions ofMAS. The date entered must not be during the current calendar year.  That is,it must be on or before December 31 or the prior calendar year.  The reasonfor this is that this data is used for collecting income information forthe purposes of comparing this data with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Children born during the current calendar year can not be entered untilnext year.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>social security number(+)</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>SSN</td><td>Answer with the individual's social security number.  Answer must be 9 numbers in length. The SSN will be sent to the SSA for verification. This status will be displayed next to the SSN.  Once an SSN hasreceived a status of Verified, it is locked from user updating and a "VERIFIED" will be displayed by the SSN field.  Only HEC staff are able to change a Spouse or Dependents verified SSN.  If SSA indicates the SSN is invalid, "INVALID" will appear next to the invalid SSN of theindividual. Facilities should make every effort to obtain the accurate SSN from the individual for any invalid or pseudo SSN. If a valid SSN is not known, then a "P" will be entered at the SSNprompt for the system to automatically assign a Pseudo-SSN.  If aPseudo SSN is entered, a Reason for entering it will be required.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>pseudo ssn reason(+)</td><td>0;10</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>R:REFUSED TO PROVIDE<br/>S:SSN UNKNOWN/FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED<br/>N:NO SSN ASSIGNED<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to document the reason the individual was assigned a pseudo SSN.  Based on your selection, the Pseudo SSN Report (Dependent) option located in the Means Test Menu can provide you a current reportof the reasons entered at this prompt.  The following reasons are available for selection: Refused to Provide - use this reason when the individual was asked for his/her SSN and refused to provide the number. SSN Unknown/Follow-up required - use this reason when the individual is not available to ask/answer the request for SSN.  The facility shouldinitiate Follow-up activity to obtain the SSN. No SSN Assigned - use this reason when the individual has not been assigned an SSN.  This generally applies to spouses or dependents of veterans who are not US citizens and infrequently, non-citizenbeneficiaries.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>ssn verification status</td><td>0;11</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>4:VERIFIED<br/>2:INVALID<br/></td><td></td><td>This field designates whether or not the SSN has been verified.
