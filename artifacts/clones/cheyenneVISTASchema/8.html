All entries in this filemust be associated with an entry in the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODEfile.  The MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE(#8.1) file consists of those codeswhich have been established by VACO MAS.  Currently there are18 eligibility codes in use by the Dept of Veterans Affairs. The site is not allowed to add entries to the MAS ELIGIBILITYCODE file. However, the site is permitted to add localentries to the ELIGIBILITY CODE file.  To add/editeligibility codes use the option 'Eligibility Code Enter/Edit[DG ELIG CODE ENTER/EDIT]'.  The option is on the'Eligibility/ID Maintenance Menu [DG ELIG MAINTENANCE]' menu. Normally, adding local codes is not needed. However, theVA/DOD sharing agreement software, being developed by theDallas ISC, does need and use this functionality. </dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>VA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the site specific name for the eligibility.In most cases the name will be the same as the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODEpointed to by the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE field of this file.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>make record sensitive?</td><td>0;12</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Answer YES if patients with this eligibility should have there recordsautomatically added to the DG SECURITY LOG file so that the patient'srecord will be listed as sensitive.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>card color(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>P:PURPLE<br/>B:BLUE<br/>R:RED<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the color of the patient's card for the MASeligibility. This field is automatically updated with the value of the'CARD COLOR' of the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE(#8.1) entrypointed to by field #8, MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE. This field is uneditable.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>abbreviation</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field may contain an abbreviation for the eligibility name.
