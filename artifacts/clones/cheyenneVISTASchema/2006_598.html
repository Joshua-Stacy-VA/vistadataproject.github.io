Then an attempt is made to transmitthe message.When the transmission is successful, the entry is removed fromthis table. When the transmission is not successful (which is likely sincemany errors that need to be transmitted have to report sometype of "network failure") the text remains in this table whilethe software on the DICOM Gateway can enter its further errorprocessing. A supervisory task on the DICOM Gateway scans the content ofthis table on a regular basis and will transmit any "left over"messages.As soon as a message has been transmitted successfully, itsentry in this table will be removed.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>header(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The value of this field is a string that is used as the headerfor the error message.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>routine</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a string that identifies a MUMPS routine.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>ignore</td><td>1;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:Create error log<br/>1:Ignore error log<br/></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a flag that indicates whether ornot an error log is to be produced.
