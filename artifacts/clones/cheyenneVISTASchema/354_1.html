The option Manually Change Copay Exemption (Hardships) canbe used to update and correct entries by creating a new exemption.If many patient records have problems the option Print/Verify PatientExemption Status can be used to correct the entries. This file will hold the time sensitive data that is used to determineif a patient can be exluded from any type of billing for a period oftime.  The initial use of this file is for storing the time sensitivedata related to whether or not a patient is exempt from pharmacy copayrequirement due to income below the pension level. The file then maintains the audit trail of changes to exemptions andhistorical data about exemptions.  The data in this file should beretained for approximately the current calendar year and the pastcalendar year.  The ability to purge data in this file will be addedat a future time. Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>effective date(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the effective date of the exemption.   Patients will be given 1 year of exemption from the Medication Copaymentrequirement from this effective date.
