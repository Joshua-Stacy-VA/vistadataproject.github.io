All entries inyou FACILITY MOVEMENT TYPE FILE (file 405.1) must point to an entry in thisfile.  This file is distributed by MAS and should NOT be altered by anyfacility.  Altering this file can severely corrupt the integrity of yourbed control movement options.  The internal entry numbers of this file areused by various packages to determine the processing necessary.  Thesenumbers and entries must remain as distributed by the MAS package.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>entry number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the internal entry number as created by VA FileManand maintained by the MAS package.  This number is used widely throughoutmany DHCP packages including MAS, dietetics, and pharmacy to determineprogramming flow.  Adding, editing, or removing entries in this file willhave severe negative impacts on software operation at your facility.  YouMUST NOT edit this data!</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name of the movement type as distributed by theMAS package under the direction of MAS VACO and the MAS SIUG.  Entriesin this file must not be edited locally, and will be maintained viafrequent MAS software upgrades.  Changes to this file could severelyimpact operations at your site.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>transaction type(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="405_3.html">405.3</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains a pointer to the MAS MOVEMENT TRANSACTION TYPE filecontaining the allowable types of bed control movements (admissions,discharges, transfers, lodger movements, etc.).  This data is distributedby the MAS package under the direction of MAS VACO and the MAS SIUG.Altering of this data in any way will have severe and negative impacts onoperations at your site.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>ask specialty at movement?(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field will contain a yes if, when entering a movement of this type,the user should also be asked if they would like to enter a specialtytransfer.  This would only be true in the case of admissions and sometransfers.  This data is distributed with the MAS package under thedirection of the MAS SIUG and MAS VACO.  Altering of this data in anyway will have severe and negative impacts on operations at your site.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>ask facility on movement?(+)</td><td>0;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field will contain a yes if, when entering a movement of this type,the user should also be asked for a 'TRANSFER FACILITY'.  This would betrue for movements such as TRANSFER IN, TRANSFER OUT, CONTINUED ASIH(OTHER FACILITY), etc. where it is necessary to prompt for the facilitywhere the patient is trasferring from or to.  This data is distributed bythe MAS package as directed by MAS VACO and the MAS SIUG.  Altering ofthis data in any way will have severe and negative impacts on operationsat your site.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>module generated/selectable?(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:MODULE GENERATED<br/>1:SELECTABLE<br/></td><td></td><td>Due to the ASIH (absent sick in hospital) functionality, there are certainmovements (a TO ASIH admission) which are entered automatically by thesystem and are not selectable.  In this case, MODULE GENERATED would beentered in this field.  For movements which the user can choose at standardTYPE OF MOVEMENT prompts, this field will be SELECTABLE.  This data isdistributed by the MAS package as directed by the MAS SIUG and MAS VACO.Altering of this data in any way will have severe and negative impacts onoperations at your site.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>ptf discharge code(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:REGULAR<br/>2:NBC OR WHILE ASIH<br/>3:EXPIRATION 6 MONTH LIMIT<br/>4:IRREGULAR<br/>5:TRANSFER<br/>6:DEATH WITH AUTOPSY<br/>7:DEATH WITHOUT AUTOPSY<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is filled in only for discharges and contains the code for thedischarge that is transmitted with the PTF record.  This data isdistributed by the MAS packge under the direction of the MAS SIUG andMAS VACO.

For admissions, this multiple will be blank as theycan not follow any other movements.  This is also true for check-in lodgermovements.  This multiple will never contain discharges or check-out lodgermovements as nothing can follow them.  The 'can only follow' syntax holdsonly for a single episode:  either a lodger episode or an admissionepisode. This data is distributed by the MAS software package under the directionand review of MAS VACO as well as the MAS expert panel.  Editing of entriesin this multiple will have severe and extremely negative affects on theoperation of the MAS software package as well as other DHCP softwarepackages.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>description(+)</td><td>D;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field will contain a brief description of the movement type.
