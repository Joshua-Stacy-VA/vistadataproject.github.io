Every registry must have a record in this file. Records of the file are uniquely identified by theregistry name (the "A" primary key and theuniqueness index "B" are used for that purpose). A permanent screen (the ^DD(798.1,0,"SCR") node) restricts access to records of this file. Userscan only access records of those registries thatthey have the security key(s) for. Users with theROR VA IRM security key can access all records ofthe file. If you want the changes in the security keys allocation to have an effect immediately, youshould rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the.01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of thisfile.
