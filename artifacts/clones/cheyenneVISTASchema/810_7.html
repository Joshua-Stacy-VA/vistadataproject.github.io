When theextract type is for COMPLIANCE TOTALS only, there will not be an extractcounting rule defined in the REMINDER EXTRACT DEFINITION file (#810.2). Whenthe extract type includes FINDING TOTALS, then the extract definition needs toreference a counting rule for each reminder processed by the extract. In the Extract definition, there is a basic hierarchy as followsExtract general information   Patient List to build and list rules to build them      Reminders to be run with the Patient List         Extract Counting Rules that define how to count findings An entry in the REMINDER EXTRACT COUNTING RULE file identifies how groups offindings should be accumulated based on the reminder status.Each group of findings is defined as a counting group in the REMINDER EXTRACTCOUNTING GROUP file (#810.8).One counting group can be referenced multiple times in a particular countingrule to collect counts in multiple ways. The unique combination of a countinggroup and a Reminder Status field is what makes the counts different. TheReminder Status field is the status associated with the patient when thereminder was evaluated. Each patient is always in the TOTAL PATIENTS count,but the patient is included in the APPLICABLE PATIENTS, DUE PATIENTS, or NOTDUE PATIENTS counts depending on the reminder status for each patient. For example: A counting group defined with possible LDL value ranges, can bedefined to get multiple counts, depending on the patient's REMINDER STATUS.When TOTAL PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group: Everypatient in the patient list is used to find a match on the findings in thegroup. If a finding match is found, a count is accumulated into columns basedon the reminder status of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. When APPLICABLE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group:Patients from the patient list, where the reminder was applicable, are used tofind a match on the findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a countis accumulated into columns for each finding in the group based on the reminderstatus of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Applicable patientsshould have 0 counts in the NOT APPLICABLE count for each finding. When DUE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group: Patientsfrom the patient list, where the reminder was due are used to find a match onthe findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a count is accumulatedinto columns for each finding in the group based on the reminder status ofAPPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Due patients should have 0 countsin the NOT APPLICABLE and NOT DUE count for each finding.When NOT DUE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group:Patients from the patient list, where the reminder was not due are used to finda match on the findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a count isaccumulated into columns for each finding in the group based on the reminderstatus of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Due patients should have0 counts in the NOT APPLICABLE and DUE count for each finding.The accumulated counts for each finding are stored in the REMINDER EXTRACTSUMMARY file (#810.3). The sequence number in the file determines the orderthe counts will be accumulated for, saved to, and displayed from the REMINDEREXTRACT SUMMARY file (#810.3). The counts can be used to make comparisons between TOTAL PATIENTS, APPLICABLEPATIENTS, DUE PATIENTS, and NOT DUE PATIENTS counts.         If no counting groups are defined in the extract counting rule, then no findingtotals will be accumulated. Nationally distributed extract counting rules are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot bemodified by sites. Sites should name locally created extract counting rules according to their local naming convention. </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the Counting Rule.
