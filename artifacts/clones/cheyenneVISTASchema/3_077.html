It is a means of providinga common key for the errors to be clustered under.  Each one will hasa series of characteristics which will be captured for later analysiseven after the error has been purged off of the ^%ZTER global.  Thefirst date and time is stored as will be the most recent occurrence.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>first date/time</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the first date and time that the error has occurred.  It is ofhistoric importance and can be used to find the causative event of the error that is being reported.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>most recent date/time</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the most recent time that the situation has happened.  It is important in that it is the most likely to still be in the error trapglobal, ^%ZTER.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>routine name</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the routine in question.  It will be parsed out of the error string in .01.  This will make the errors much easier to clusteraround the causitive routine.  This may actually be amended from the error string presentation if the causative program is found to be different.</td></tr><tr><td>3.1</td><td>application</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="9_4.html">9.4</a></td><td></td><td>This field will help to identify who are the responsible parties for thisproblem.
