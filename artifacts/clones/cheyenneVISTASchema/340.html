By editing thisfile directly data corruption can occur. This file holds information pertaining to debtor accounts.

Anaccount can belong to an insurance company, vendor, institution, person,or patient.

A site can define briefor detailed information for each patient to be displayed on thestatement.  Brief information consists only of the RX # and Fill date,while the expanded information consists of much more (Physician, drugname, etc.).</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>statement day</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>AC</td><td>A statement day is assigned to all types of debtors, except insurancecompanies.  A statement day is the day that a patient statement isgenerated or a follow-up letter is generated for non-benefit debts.The AR package will hold 'notifications' from being sent until thedebtors 'statement day' arrives.  This allows all activity since theprevious statement to print and update the debtor on the accountactivity. Patient statement days never change, but Institution, Person, and Vendorstatement days are changed by the AR software.  When these type debtorshave a new active bill, the date the new active bill is created becomestheir 'statement day'.  This statement day remains in effect until noactive bills exist for the debtor, at which time the statement dayis 'deleted'. Insurance companies are notified based on a bill-specific date.Since insurance companies have much more activity, they are notifiedon a constant basis depending on each individual bill 'due-date'.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>receivable code</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:DEFAULT<br/>1:FEDERAL<br/>2:NON-FEDERAL<br/>3:OWCP<br/></td><td></td><td>This field identifies the type of of debtor</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>vendor link</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="440.html">440</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to link a vendor from file 440 to a debtor that is nota vendor debtor.
