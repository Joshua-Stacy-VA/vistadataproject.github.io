This is done either by a user through a calling application(user unresolved narratives) or by the calling application (applicationunresolved narratives).  USER UNRESOLVED NARRATIVES occur when the user searches the Lexicon and fails to find a suitable expression in the Expression file (#757.01).  If the user select to use his/her originaltext, then user's input is temporarily stored in this file.  However, for aUser Unresolved Narrative to be stored, the calling application must be defined in the Subset Definition file (757.2) and have the Unresolved Narrative flag set to 1.  APPLICATION UNRESOLVED NARRATIVE occur when anapplication detects a problem with an expression in the Expression file (757.01).  The application can return the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of that expression along with a short comment stating the problem. Periodicallythe entries in this file will be packed up into a mail message and sent to G.LEXICON@ISC-SLC.VA.GOV for consideration for possible inclusionin the Lexicon.  After the mail message is sent the entries in thisfile are deleted.  NOTE:  This file is exported without data.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>narrative(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>User input to the Lexicon look-up which could not be resolved (no entries found or no entry selected).</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>date-time(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Date and Time that the unresolved user narrative was added to the file(generated by LEXA1).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>search string</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the actual string used to conduct the search in the Lexicon.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>matches</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of matches found during the search when the UnresolvedNarrative occurred.
