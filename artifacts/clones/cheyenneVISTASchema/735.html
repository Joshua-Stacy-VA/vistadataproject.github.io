The field will be used by the Quality Improvement Checklist national data base for question selection during the data download process.</td></tr><tr><td>.75</td><td>control question</td><td>0;3</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field identifies which questions are control questions.  "1" means yesand "0" means no.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>input text</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the Quality Improvement Checklist question as it isdisplayed on the Answer Survey and Edit Survey Entry options.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>response type</td><td>2;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>D:DATE<br/>F:FREE-TEXT<br/>N:NUMERIC<br/>S:SET OF CODES<br/>Y:YES/NO<br/>W:WORD-PROCESSING<br/>C:COMPUTED<br/></td><td></td><td>This field identifies the data type of the answer to the questionon the Quality Improvement Checklist.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>reader variables</td><td>2;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the required variables for each question onthe Quality Improvement Checklist.  Based on the data type ofthe expected answer, which is stored in the RESPONSE TYPE field,additional information may be needed for the DIR generalpurpose reader which is used for input.  This field contains theinformation for the second piece of the DIR(0) variable.</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>affected computed fields</td><td>2;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the internal entry numbers of any computed fieldsthat would be affected if the value for this question were to change.For example, a data element called "Number of Anesthetic Procedures"is used for the denominator for several specific surgical procedures.Since the number of anesthetic procedures is only entered once, ifit changes it will affect the computed percentage rate for all ofthe surgical procedures.The range of IENs for the surgical procedures would be entered asNNN,NNN,NNN etc.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>question prompt</td><td>2;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field stores the data which will be used by the DIR("A") variable, which is the customized prompt asked for each question on the Quality Improvement Checklist survey.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>brief help</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field stores the data which will be displayed if the user entersone question mark for brief help.  The data will be used by theDIR("?") variable to customize the help prompt for each question.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>opc flag</td><td>4;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Flag indicates if OPC must answer this question.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>survey date</td><td>5;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="735_03.html">735.03</a></td><td></td><td>This field points to each Quality Improvement Checklist survey which will contain this question.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>graphics flag</td><td>10;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NOT TO BE GRAPHED<br/>1:RAM GROUPING<br/>2:COMPLEXITY LEVEL GROUPING<br/>3:RUNON GRAPH<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag will denote if a question is to be downloaded for nationalgraphics reports."0" - not to be included in graphs"1" - to be included as graph for RAM Groupings"2" - to be included as graph for Complexity Level Groupings"3" - to be included as "runon" graph (all sites)</td></tr><tr><td>20.5</td><td>y-axis label</td><td>10;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field will contain a brief "Y-AXIS" label to be used for questionsthat are graphable items.  This label will be included in the downloadroutine for the PC.</td></tr><tr><td>20.51</td><td>disclaimer flag</td><td>10;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Flag indicates which disclaimer will be placed on the national graphfor this question.</td></tr><tr><td>20.6</td><td>excel menu text</td><td>10;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Each question which is designated for graphics will be downloaded into the QUIC Automated Graphing System in Excel.  The Excel system will use the data from the EXCEL MENU TEXT field to match the user's menu choice with the spreadsheet data used to produce the graph.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>rare event flag</td><td>11;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag will be set to "1" if the QUIC question has been designatedas a rare event indicator.  The designated questions will be downloadedfor the National Rare Event Report.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>out-of-range flag</td><td>12;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag will be set to "1" if the QUIC question is to be reviewedprior to data transmission.  The individual transmitting the datawill be warned if selected answers exceed 100% (or an OQM specified upper limit) or if selected answers equal zero (0).</td></tr><tr><td>22.1</td><td>upper limit</td><td>12;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>QUIC questions which have the OUT-OF-RANGE FLAG set to "1" may have the UPPER LIMIT field set.  If the UPPER LIMIT field is set, it will contain the highest expected answer.  At transmission time, questions will be reviewed to determine if the answer is beyond the expected limit.The individual transmitting the data will be warned if answers exceedthe UPPER LIMIT (this is usually 100%).</td></tr><tr><td>22.2</td><td>zero flag</td><td>12;3</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>QUIC questions which have the OUT-OF-RANGE FLAG set to "1" may havethe ZERO FLAG field set.  If the ZERO FLAG field is set, it indicatesthat zero (0) is an unacceptable answer for this question.  Attransmission time, questions will be reviewed to determine if theanswer equals zero (0).  The individual transmitting the data will bewarned if this occurs and will be given an opportunity to edit the answer.If the individual transmitting the data does not heed the warning andchooses to send the erroneous data, the software makes a conversion.If the answer to this question equals zero (0), the software convertsthe answer to "ERR" prior to transmission.  This prevents the "0"answer from skewing the national and RAM group averages.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>non-applicable flag</td><td>13;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag will be set to "1" if the answer to the QUIC question isto be converted to "N/A" prior to transmission if the facility answeredthe question with a "0".  This would be the case when a facilityperforms a specific service/function, however, during the survey period, there was no request for that service/function.  This prevents the"0" answer from skewing the national and RAM group averages.</td></tr><tr><td>23.1</td><td>affected entries</td><td>13;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The AFFECTED ENTRIES field is to be used in conjunction with theNON-APPLICABLE FLAG.  If the NON-APPLICABLE FLAG is set for aquestion and if a facility answers zero (0) for that question,prior to transmission that answer is converted to "N/A".  However,there may be other parts of the question which should also bemarked as non-applicable if the "core" part of the answer was zero.For example, if the question pertains to the "number of procedures"performed, and a facility answers zero, then logically, there couldhave been no deaths or a mortality rate associated with "zero"procedures.  The AFFECTED ENTRIES field contains the internal entrynumber(s) of the question(s) which will be converted.</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td>national graph header</td><td>99;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the header used when graphing this question.</td></tr><tr><td>99.1</td><td>nat'l graph table of contents</td><td>99.1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the QUIC question in a format suitable fordownloading for incorporation into the national graph manuals.</td></tr><tr><td>99.2</td><td>oqm spreadsheet header</td><td>99.2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the column header used in Excel spreadsheets by OQM.</td></tr><tr><td>99.3</td><td>nat'l avg comparison flag</td><td>99.2;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>G:GREATER THAN NAT'L AVG<br/>L:LESS THAN NAT'L AVG<br/></td><td></td><td>This flag will indicate whether being above or below the Nat'l averagefor this question is a positive position for a facility.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
