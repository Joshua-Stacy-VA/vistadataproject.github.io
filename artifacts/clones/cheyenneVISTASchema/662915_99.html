It is currently being expanded to also allowapplications like a Pharmacy BB display, and for remote display where amedical center provides night/off hours service to other MCs. It isexpected that it can be expanded and/or utilized in its original formfor any application locally decided. The original was designed essentially to display non-verified nursingorders and is a hard addressed printer-assignment throught the M -> VMSdevice system. It now also contains a broker-based application (fromPortland) and a web-based application (from Murfreesboro).  We areexpecting to pack all these into one package for interested sites.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Create a single entry to hold the parameters for tracking ordersand displaying the bingo board.</td></tr><tr><td>.2</td><td>big or small</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>B:BIG<br/>S:SMALL<br/></td><td></td><td>This determines the size of the numbers on the bingo board screen.BIG uses the graphics Kernal calls to draw numbers on the screen.SMALL uses the double high double wide characteristics to write numbers.</td></tr><tr><td>.3</td><td>hang time</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The time in seconds between 1 and 300 to wait before refreshing thebingo board.  When testing the bingo board, set this to a low rate(e.g. 10) to see the changes on the bingo board.  When testing iscomplete, set this to a slower refresh rate, e.g. 60.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>header message</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2.1</td><td>date stamp to capture</td><td>2;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>OA:ORDER DT ALL<br/>OS:ORDER DT SINGLE<br/>R:RLSE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to determine how to count how many orders a patienthas.  Using 'R' will increment the count by one for each uniquerelease date/time.  Using 'OS' will increment the count by one foreach unique order date/time.  Using 'OA' will increment the count foreach new order for a patient.</td></tr><tr><td>2.2</td><td>display unit</td><td>2;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>W:WARD<br/>B:BED<br/>L:LOCAL<br/>P:PHARMACY<br/>F:FACILITY<br/></td><td>DU</td><td>A display unit is each individual entity that displays on thebingo board.  The total count of new orders as determined byfield #2.1 DATE STAMP TO CAPTURE is shown in each display unit. Use WARD or BED to count the new orders per ward or bed. Use LOCAL if your site wishes to count orders for a locallydefined entity.  For example, San Francisco counts orders pera group of rooms.  When using LOCAL, custom code must be writtento define display unit.  This code is entered in field #3LOCAL EXECUTE CODE.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>local execute code</td><td>3;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is only used if the value of field 2.2 DISPLAY UNIT is setto LOCAL.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>cutoff time</td><td>PS;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the time that inpatient orders are relayed to a remote pharmacy.When entering this time, be sure to allow for overlap of servicesbetween your pharmacy and its remote provider that will be continuingthe service. </td></tr><tr><td>10.1</td><td>medical center</td><td>PS;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4_2.html">4.2</a></td><td></td><td>this field was entered for Pharmacy BBs, but can be locally utilizedfor whatever.

It was set up to assist pharmacy with the gradual implementationof BCMA. Only wards that were starting the BCMA process were included.However, with the interest by other sites in the country and notnecessarily wanting the ward listing restricted, this field has beenincluded into Ann Chu's BB parameter system. So, Use Pharm Wards File?  0 means that ARHCOPB (and BC) will list any ward.  1 means that ARHCOPB (and BC) will use only wards listed in 648041.</td></tr><tr><td>10.5</td><td>scroll pharm bb?</td><td>PS;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This pertains strictly for the inpatient (and outpatient) pharmacy BBsystem. The intent of the board is to display non-verified orders (forinpatients from 53.1, and for outpatients from its OPT shadow), theoldest urgency on top, and then after that, the oldest non-urgent orderon top. Even thought the display can be compressed, it can be larger than thedisplayable screen. The Pharm BB system is set to a 30 second refresh. So, SCROLL PHARM BB:0 (NO) means that the display will always refresh from the oldest tothe newest orders in 53.1, and will not scroll up beyond the oldestorders. 1 (YES) means that a refresh will scroll to the next screen, if thereis the list of orders is longer than the current display screen.</td></tr><tr><td>10.6</td><td>use pharm/ward indicators</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10.7</td><td>verifications screen</td><td>VERPROC;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NOT APPLICABLE<br/>1:NURSE VERIFICATION ONLY<br/>2:CLERK VERIFICATION ONLY<br/>3:RN AND CLERK VERIFICATION REQUIRED<br/></td><td></td><td>Portland VAMC has wards that have mixed responsibilities for verificationof orders. Ward secretaries are responsible for certain labs ontreatment. However, under the original version of the Indianapolisenhancement, an order verified by a clerk or nurse will be removed fromthe board. This parameter is meant to assist sites (like Portland) whereclerks may act on orders, there behavior on verification will bemaintained, and nurses, additionally will view those orders.An order at Portland will only be cleared when the clerk AND the nursehave verified. Hence, the set of codes in the parameter file. jim bell4/5/01</td></tr><tr><td>10.8</td><td>display other wards</td><td>PS;8</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter is only used by the Pharmacy Inpatient Bingo Board.If this is set to yes, then pending orders that show up under"Other" in option "Non-Verified/Pending Orders" will be includedon the display.
