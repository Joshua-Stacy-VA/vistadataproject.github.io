Each record associates a patientwith a registry and contains registry-specific andadditional service information (when the patient was added to the registry, if they were confirmed,etc). Records of the file are uniquely identified by the patient and the registry (the "A" primary keyand the uniqueness index "KEY" are used for thatpurpose). When the record of this file is deleted, the logicof the ADELETE cross-reference tries to delete theassociated records from the ROR HIV RECORD (#799.4), ROR PATIENT (#798.4), and ROR PATIENTEVENTS (#798.3) files. A permanent screen (the ^DD(798,0,"SCR") node) restricts access to records of this file. Userscan only access records of those registries thatthey have the security key(s) for. Users with theROR VA IRM security key can access all records ofthe file. If you want the changes in the security keysallocation to have an effect immediately, you should rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the.01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of the RORREGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1). See thedescription of the cross-reference for moredetails.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>patient name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="798_4.html">798.4</a></td><td>B</td><td>The PATIENT NAME field identifies a patient in theregistry.
