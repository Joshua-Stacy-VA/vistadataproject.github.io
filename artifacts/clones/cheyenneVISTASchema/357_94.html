Currently only PCL5 is supported for scannable encounter forms.  Simplex and Duplex printing is supported on all printersthat have duplex printing ability.  Generally all HP printers (HP3 and above) support PCL5.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>printer language type</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PCL5<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter the printer control language that this terminal type supports forprinting scannable encounter forms.  Currently only PCL5 is supported. If this terminal type supports PCL5 then enter PCL5, otherwise this shouldbe left blank.  Generally all HP printers (HP3 and above) support PCL5.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>simplex</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the code used to put this printer into Simplex mode (one sidedprint).  For PCL5 printers this generally is $C(27)_"&l0S".  Be carefulwhen typing this in, the character sequence is: Escape, ampersand, lowercase L, numeral zero, capital S.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>duplex, long-edge binding</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the code used to put this printer into Duplex mode, longEdge Binding (two sided printing, like you'd use in a binder).  For PCL5 printers this generally is $C(27)_"&l1S".  Be carefulwhen typing this in, the character sequence is: Escape, ampersand, lowercase L, numeral 1, capital S.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>duplex, short-edge binding</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the code used to put this printer into Duplex mode, shortEdge Binding (two sided printing, like you'd use in a patient chart).For PCL5 printers this generally is $C(27)_"&l2S".  Be carefulwhen typing this in, the character sequence is: Escape, ampersand, lowercase L, numeral 2, capital S.                                            </td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>tcp printer</td><td>0;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter 'Yes' if this is a TCP printer terminal type such as P-REMOTE.  Currently the duplex printing of Encounter Forms does not work correctlywhen sent to a TCP printer using a Jet Direct card.  The problem is thatat the end of the first page the printer appears to overflow causing a formfeed.  The subsequent form feed then causes the back of the page to beblank and the beginning of page 2 to start on a new page.  While this issueis actively being reseached at the time of release of AICS v3 it has not been resolved.  As a work around, entering a 'Yes' at this prompt willsuppress the form feeds at the end of the page.  Limited testing has shown this to be effective in producing duplex encounter forms.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>reset execute code</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the printer code that you would like sent to the printer immediatelyafter a reset is sent when using PCL5 to print encounter forms.  This isprimarily intended to support changes to which bin the paper should besent to.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
