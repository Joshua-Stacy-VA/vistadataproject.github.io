Radiographs usually will not be taken, but may be ifPROFESSIONALLY DETERMINED to be necessary as for an emergency.  A chartreview (patient not present at time of review) is also classed as ascreening exam.  When a chart review is entered the provider must also markADMIN PROCEDURE on the screen to avoid a "patient visit" count.Note:  Providers must be aware of significant medical problems; therefore,a medical and dental history and/or medical record review must be included.Recall examinations (may be less than six months) would be included in thisarea.  The screening examination is an essential part of the admissionphysical examination.  All INPATIENT screening examinations will be placedin a Priority 1 Category.  If the inpatient does not fall into Emergency,Extended Care, NHCU, Dom, or Special Provisions, s/he would be placed inthe Compelling Medical Need Category.  All OUTPATIENT screeningexaminations will be placed in Priority 1. COMPLETE EXAMINATIONA complete examination includes dental charting on a tooth by tooth basisas well as the comprehensive evaluation of the oral and perioral softtissues. A head and neck exam is included as an essential portion of thecomplete examination.  A thorough review of the medical chart and medicalhistory with the pertinent medical findings noted on the dental recordare included in the complete examination.  A complete examination will beaccomplished for a patient who is to receive treatment other thanemergency care.

Evaluations may be in conjunctionwith review of a medical record, the initiation of an interdisciplinaryconsultion or with a medical or dental emergency workup on a patientfor whom no definitive treatment is delivered. An evaluation made by thestaff mentor for trainees at a scheduled treatment visit prior to carryingout a specific treatment procedure is counted as education time.All other INPATIENT evaluations will be placed in a Priority 1 Category.If the inpatient does not fall into Emergency, Extended Care, NHCU, Dom, orSpecial Provisions, s/he would be placed in the Compelling Medical Need Category.

In the caseof long term care patients, including NHC and Dom patients, a count for acompleted case may be taken once in each six months if re-examinationindicated need for another episode of care.  For outpatients, only onecomplete case count may be taken per episode of care for which a treatmentplan was established, even if there were intervening terminations.  If,after an outpatient case has been completed and s/he is eligible forrecall, another episode of care may begin with the recall examination iftreatment is indicated.  Treatment plans will not be segmented for thepurpose of multiple completions during an episode of care.  For casesadministratively completed, also make an entry in the ADMIN PROCEDUREfield. TERMINATIONS A case is terminated when an episode of care is interrupted or stoppedshort of completion of the authorized treatment plan.  Examples of thiswould be the death of a patient, discharge to OPT status, closure ofthe case due to failed appointments, health reasons, or at the patient'srequest.
