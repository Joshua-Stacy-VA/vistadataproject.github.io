For each clinic, this file holds its name, stop code,credit stop code, and DSS alternatives for both stop code and credit stopcode.  Also included is a field indicating which code should be sent to theDSS commercial software, that is, stop code, credit stop code, or both.  Ifthere is no data in this file for a given clinic, the stop code in theHOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) will be used.  If DSS alternate stopcodes are entered, they will be used in place of those entered in theHOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  This file should be reviewed by theDSS manager on a regular basis and corrected as needed.  Since severalfields in this file are linked to fields in the HOSPITAL LOCATIONfile (#44), data in this file should be entered and edited only by usingthe DSS software and not by direct access via VA FileMan.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>clinic name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44.html">44</a></td><td>B</td><td>The name of the clinic.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>stop code</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The stop code for this clinic as determined by Medical AdministrationService (MAS).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>credit stop code</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The credit stop code, if none exists, for this clinic as determinedby Medical Administration Service (MAS). </td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>dss stop code</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Three digit Stop Code number assigned to specific location.
