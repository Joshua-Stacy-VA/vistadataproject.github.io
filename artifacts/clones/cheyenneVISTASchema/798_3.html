These references are used to speed up the regular registry updates. Records of the file have the same internal entry numbers as the internal values of the PATIENT NAMEfield ('DINUM' feature).</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>patient name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>B</td><td>The PATIENT NAME field identifies the patient.

Otherwise, thedata in the interval between those dates will notbe checked and some important information may bemissed.     This date cannot be stored in the registry file (#798) because the patient has not been added tothe registry yet. So, the date is stored in thismultiple.       Before the registry update process begins searching the data of the patient, it tries tofind a record for that patient in this multiple.If it exists, the date from the record is used inthe search instead of regular date (from theREGISTRY UPDATED UNTIL field of the REGISTRYPARAMETERS file.     After successfully processing the patient data, the corresponding record is deleted from thismultiple.       Records of the multiple are uniquely identified bythe registry IEN. The "A" primary key and the "B"uniqueness index are used for this purpose. Usually, records within this multiple should notbe edited. Its content is handled automatically byentry points from the routine RORUPP01 during theregistry update.       However, if the errors are not corrected in the predefined time frame (2 weeks at the moment),patient data will not be analyzed by the subsequent registry updates until someone fixes the errors and resets the COUNTER field of thepatient records in this multiple.  </td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>event</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="798_32.html">798.32</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple stores event references created bythe event protocols. The registry update usesthese references to speed up the processing. The event references are grouped by the data areas(protocols) and only one reference per associated date (the DATE field) for each data area is storedat the moment. The "AD" cross-reference is used bythe $$ADD^RORUPP02 function for this purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
