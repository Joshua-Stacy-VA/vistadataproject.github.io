File entries are created by the Regenerate Census Workfile option of the Census module. The file is used to produce the Census Status Report.  Without thisworkfile, it would be necessary to search all admissions in orderto compile this report.  This file eliminates that processing.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2.html">2</a></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name of the inpatient.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>admission date</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the admission date and time associated with thisworkfile entry.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>admission entry</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="405.html">405</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains the internal entry number to the patient'sadmission multiple.
