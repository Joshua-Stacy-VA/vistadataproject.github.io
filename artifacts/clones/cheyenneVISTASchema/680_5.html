Certain issuing patterns bypublishers do not lend themselves to the establishment of aprediction pattern, most notably those quarterly publicationswhich are labeled with seasonal designations such as spring,winter, etc.  In order for a prediction pattern to be created,the serials title must be dated in a MM/YY or MM/DD/YY format.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>frequency</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="680_2.html">680.2</a></td><td></td><td>This field provides for the frequency of issue which hasbeen assigned in the National Library Files Maintenanceoption on FORUM.
