It is distributed to the field with entries andthe associated data of centrally purchased DHCP ADP equipment as well as local purchases bought by facilities that have been added to the file.When a facility is creating or updating their individual inventories in theVHS&RA ADP TRACKING SYSTEM file (2056), an item is selected from this masterfile (2056.31) and the corresponding data for that model number is then"defined" into the VHS&RA ADP TRACKING SYSTEM file (2056) for that facility.It contains components, CRTs, printers, micom equipment, communication devices and "other" IO equipment. For each model number the following aredefined: general category, type, manufacturer, description, averagecost and VA System category. The site managers may add entries to this file.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>model no.(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the equipment model number.</td></tr><tr><td>.013</td><td>description(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter a brief description of the item, 1-40 characters in length.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>gsa manufacturer code(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>AF</td><td>The 3 character manufacturer code is a standard identifierassigned to each manufacturer by GSA.A comprehensive listing has been included with the documentation.Below are the most common GSA manufacturer codes:    DEQ stands for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)  HMP stands for Hayes Microcomputer Products  MNY stands for Mannnesman Tally  MIM stands for Micom Systems, Inc.  QUM stands for Qume Incorporated  WYS stands for Wyse</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>general category(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:COMPONENT<br/>2:CRT<br/>3:PRINTER<br/>4:PERS COMP<br/>5:MICOM<br/>6:COMM EQUIP<br/>7:OTHER I/O<br/></td><td>AE</td><td>The General Category field is used to categorize the typeof equipment in one of the following classifications:  .
