The code is attached to an exam at the same time the interpretingresident and/or staff physician is entered for the exam. The diagnosticcode represents a quick overall summary of what the interpreting physicianwrote in his/her report concerning the exam. [NOTE: Diagnostic code is notthe impression. The impression is stored in the 'IMPRESSION' field of the'RAD/NUC MED REPORTS' file (#74).] The following is the list of codes that are loaded when themodule is initialized:          1) NORMAL         2) MINOR ABNORMALITY         3) MINOR ABNORMALITY, NO ATTN, NEEDED         4) ABNORMALITY, ATTN. NEEDED         5) MAJOR ABNORMALITY, PHYSICIAN AWARE         6) UNDICTATED FILMS NOT RETURNED, 3 DAYS         7) UNSATISFACTORY/INCOMPLETE EXAM         8) POSSIBLE MALIGNANCY, FOLLOW-UP NEEDED As part of the system customization process, these entries can be deleted.However, once the system is in production, you should 'not' delete anyentries. Adding new entries is always allowed. If the site decides to enter diagnostic codes for exams, thendatabase searches can be performed using the 'DIAGNOSTIC CODE'field of the exam record in the search criteria. For example, thedatabase can be searched for all 'normal' chest procedures.  Data Storage ------------The data for the 'DIAGNOSTIC CODES' file is stored in the ^RA(78.3,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates ---------------The package does not use any input templates associated with thisfile.  Print Templates --------------- The following is a list of print templates used by the package:  Name                      Description; Option(s) ----                    ---------------------- DIAGNOSTIC CODE PRINT    Prints a list of entries in this file;                          RA DIAGP  Sort Templates --------------The package does not use any sort templates associated with thisfile.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the number of this diagnostic code.
