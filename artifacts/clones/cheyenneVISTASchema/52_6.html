Any drug entered in this file must already exist inthe DRUG file (50). All drug information relating to its use in theIV package is stored in the IV ADDITIVES file. If a drug is no longerto be used as an IV additive, DO NOT delete it from the IV ADDITIVEfile, but simply inactivate it by entering the date it is to be dis-continued in the INACTIVATION field.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PSJI</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>print name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field should contain the print name of the 'GENERIC DRUG' (file #50).The print name entered here will be printed on the IV label, Ward list,Manufacturing list etc.  It should not contain strength, since strengthis entered with each individual IV order.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>generic drug(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="50.html">50</a></td><td>AC</td><td>  This field is the pointer from the IV ADDITIVES (52.6) to the DRUG file(#50).

You might enter '2' for this field.             This will represent 2 MEQ/ML.
