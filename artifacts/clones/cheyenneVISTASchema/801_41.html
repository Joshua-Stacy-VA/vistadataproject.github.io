Reminder dialog definitions are used by the CPRS GUI for reminder resolution.   This file contains a combination of nationally distributed entries, local auto-generated entries, site and VISN exchanged entries and local manually created entries. Nationally distributed dialog, element, and group entries have their name prefixed with VA-. Nationally distributed Prompts, Forced Value, Result Groups, and Result Elements have their name prefixed with PXRM. Entries in this file may be auto-generated via the Dialog Management Menu option. Manually created dialog entries should use local namespacing conventions. Nationally distributed entries will have their class type defined as National. Entries created at the VISN level should be defined as VISN and entries created at a site should be defined as Local.   This file is similar to the option file where there are different types of entries (reminder dialog, dialog elements (sentences), prompts, and groups of elements, result elements and groups of result elements). Where an option has menu items, the dialog file has components that are entered, with the sequence field as the .01 field.  A prompt is defined for PCE prompts, WH Notification Purpose, or as locally created comment check-boxes. The prompts will not have any components within them. PXRM-prefixed prompts are distributed in this file with the Clinical Reminder package.   A dialog element is defined primarily to represent sentences to display in the CPRS window with a check-box. When the user checks the sentence off, theFINDING ITEM in the dialog element and the ADDITIONAL FINDINGS will be added to the list of PCE updates, orders, WH Notification Purposes, and mental health tests. The updates won't occur on the CPRS GUI until the user clicks on the FINISH button. Dialog elements may have components added to them. Auto-generated components will be based on the additional prompts defined in the Finding Type Parameters. Once a dialog element is auto-generated, the sites can modify them.   Dialog elements may also be instructional text or a header. The FINDING ITEM and components would not be defined in dialog elements.   A dialog group is similar to menu options. It groups dialog elements and dialog groups within its component multiple. The dialog group can be defined with a finding item and a check-box. The components in the group can be hidden from the CPRS GUI window until the dialog group is checked off.  A result element contains special logic that uses information entered during the resolution process to create a sentence to add to the progress note. The special logic contains a CONDITION that, when true, will use the ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field to update the progress note. A separate result element is used for each separate sentence needed. The result element is only used with mental health test finding items. Default result elements are distributed for common mental health tests, prefixed with PXRM and the mental health test name. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions as needed.   A result group contains all of the result elements that need to be checked to create sentences for one mental health test finding. The dialog element for the test will have its RESULT GROUP/ELEMENT field defined with the result group. Default result groups for mental health tests are distributed with the Clinical Reminders package. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions as needed.  Sites should name locally created items according to their local naming convention.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the dialog entry. Dialogs that are auto-generated from a reminder will default to the name of the reminder for ease in identifying the reminder dialog entry. Dialog elements that are auto-generated use the following naming convention:  Finding type prefix_ _Name from finding file_ _Resolution Status. Examples of two dialog element entry names generated from an Exam file entry for DIABETIC EYE EXAM follow.  EX DIABETIC EYE EXAM DONE EX DIABETIC EYE EXAM DONE ELSEWHERE                                  Any item created locally can use any type of naming convention. Your site may want to create special namespacing for dialog entries that you create locally. Entries prefixed with PXRM are prompts, result groups, and result elements that were distributed with the Clinical Reminders package. The PXRM-prefixed prompts are the additional prompts that can be asked for particular types of PCE findings and WH Notification Purpose. For example: PXRM COMMENT can be added to any PCE file to allow the user to enter an additional COMMENT beyond the dialog element's progress note text, and the PXRM LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING can only be used with PCE Education Topic findings.  </td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>source reminder</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="811_9.html">811.9</a></td><td>AG</td><td>This identifies which reminder definition is associated with this"Reminder Dialog" entry.

If a dialog item ismarked as DISABLE AND SEND MESSAGE and a user tries to use it inCPRS, a message will be sent to the Clinical Reminders mail group.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>type(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>P:prompt<br/>E:dialog element<br/>R:reminder dialog<br/>F:forced value<br/>G:dialog group<br/>S:result group<br/>T:result element<br/></td><td>TYPE</td><td>This field defines what type of dialog component this entry is. Thetype determines the processing that can occur with this entry.  Reminder dialogs are the dialog entries that can be mapped to areminder definition. Reminder dialogs will typically contain severaldialog elements and/or dialog groups.  Dialog elements that are auto-generated represent a finding item andresolution status combination, based on the Finding Type Parameters forauto-generation. The dialog elements can be defined manually ifneeded. Dialog elements must have the FINDING ITEM field defined inorder to cause the finding to be updated automatically. When nofinding item is defined, the dialog element is treated as a header orinstruction text in the CPRS GUI. Sites can also add Additional Findingitems to automatically update when a dialog element is checked off. Anexample of using the additional finding would be for a dialog elementfor a diagnosis, that must always be recorded with a second diagnosis.Another example is when an Exam or Education Topic dialog elementchecked off should automatically add an additional ICD9 and/or CPTfinding to PCE. Dialog elements will use the DIALOG/PROGRESS NOTE TEXT to display inthe CPRS GUI window. This text will also be added to the progress note,unless the optional ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field is defined. Ifthe dialog text to display to the user needs to be different from thetext to add to the progress note, use the ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXTfield to define the progress note text. Dialog Groups can be used to group dialog elements together. Groupscan be displayed with a box around them and have selection rulesapplied to them (e.g., select one, one or more)  A dialog element canbe changed to a dialog group by changing its TYPE.Prompts are distributed in the PXRM namespace to represent additionalfields that the user can enter when an element is checked off. Promptsare added to dialog elements during auto-generation based on thefinding type parameters. The PXRM COMMENT field is a generic commentfield that can be used on all PCE related finding items. Dialogelements for "DONE ELSEWHERE" need to require the historical visit dateprompt. The forced value is similar to a prompt, except it representsa stuffed prompt which doesn't need to be presented to answer. The PXRMprompts can be copied for local modification to create additionalforced value entries if necessary. Prompts created locally (not copies of PXRM prompts) are treated asdisplay text with checkboxes, which, when checked off, add text to acomment field which is added to the progress note text. Refer to theseas Local Comment Prompts. Result Groups and Result Elements are distributed in the PXRM namespaceand are associated with Mental Health Instrument finding items duringauto-generation of a reminder dialog. When the mental health instrumentfinding item dialog element is selected by the CPRS GUI user, a windowwill be opened which contains the test's questions and probable answers.The selected answers are sent to the mental health package when theuser selects OK. The mental health package returns the score andresults which can be used within sentences. These sentences are definedas Result Elements, and can vary depending on the test score. Ifmultiple sentences are possible depending on the score, the resultelements should be defined in a result group. The result group shouldbe added to the mental health test's dialog elements RESULTGROUP/ELEMENT field. Mental Health tests for use by Mental Healthclinicians only are not available for CPRS reminder resolution. A reminder dialog can be made into a dialog group and added to anotherreminder's dialog. This allows multiple reminders to be addressed byone reminder dialog. Reminder Dialogs can include dialog elements that don't have anythingto do with the findings defined in the reminder. Taxonomy dialogs are auto-generated based on the Taxonomy DialogParameters. The taxonomy dialog can be used as a black box that allowsthe users to enter current or historical encounter diagnoses orprocedures, based on the selectable list of diagnosis parameters. Alternatively, a taxonomy can have individual dialog elements createdfor each coded value in the selectable list of diagnoses andprocedures. It may be more useful for sites to create dialog elementsfor the common diagnoses and procedures they actively use and add themto groups, similar to the encounter form section and coded valuegroupings.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>caption</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The caption is used for prompt, dialog group, and reminder components.When a prompt has a caption defined, this is the text that should beused whenever the prompt is asked (e.g., Comment:).
