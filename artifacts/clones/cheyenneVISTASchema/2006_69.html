Otherwise, use of VistaRad provides read-only access to VISTAdata.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>recent exams days limit</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The RECENT Exams list shows all exams having a Status of Interpreted orTranscribed.  The list can be further restricted to show only exams up to'N' days old--use this field to define a value for 'N'.  Note that formost sites, Exams are likely to be marked Complete within 3 to 4 workingdays of being Interpreted, at which point they no longer show up on theRECENT Exams list.  If NOT defined, the system defaults to  a value of 6.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>unread exams days limit</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The UNREAD Exams list shows all exams having a Status of EXAMINED.  Thelist can be further restricted to show only exams up to 'N' days old--usethis field to define a value for 'N'.  If NOT defined, the system defaultsto a value of 30.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>prefetch active?</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Exam images that have been archived, e.g. to jukebox storage, may beretrieved to magnetic disk at the time a new exam is registered for apatient.  Enabling this allows immediate retrieval of the patient's priorexams when the radiologist is ready to read the new exam.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>autodisplay active?</td><td>0;6</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Enabling this turns on automatic retrieval and display of the patient'sprior exams when the radiologist reads a new exam.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>list only exams having images?</td><td>0;7</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Some sites may have a mix of exams that do, and do not, have images storeddigitally.  In this case, the UNREAD, ACTIVE and PENDING exams lists maybe optionally configured to either list only the exams that have imagesavailable for display on the VistaRad workstation, or to list all exams,including those that do not have images available for display.NOTE that the Patient Exams List always lists ALL exams, regardless ofwhether images exist or not.</td></tr><tr><td>5.5</td><td>enable series display?</td><td>0;12</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>The Vistarad Viewer code is not yet able to distinguish between differentimage series within one exam.  However, the back-end code often candetermine which images in a study may be grouped into separate series, andcan feed image information to the viewer that allow it to recognize anddisplay these separate series in separate "exam" windows.  This promptallows the Vistarad site to turn this processing on or off.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>background compile exam lists?</td><td>0;8</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>The process of compiling UNREAD & RECENT exam lists from the radiologydatabase may be relatively lengthy.  To enable these lists to reachthe radiology workstation rapidly, they can be compiled periodicallyin the background on the Vista system.  Enabling this option generallyshould provide for very fast retrieval of the exam lists.Note, however, that on the UNREAD Exams list the most recently completed("EXAMINED") exams may not appear on the list, up to a time limit definedbelow; however, exams that are "INTERPRETED" will be dropped from theUNREAD list, even in between compiles.UNREAD compiles are automatically started by requesting an UNREAD Examslist at the workstation.  The background program is initiated via aninternal TaskMan call, but it will run continuously in the backgroundafter being initiated. The RECENT compile is initiated using the TaskManScheduled Options capability.  The Option to schedule is MAGJ SCHED RECENTLIST COMPILE; it is recommended that this process be scheduled to runevery 30 to 90 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>unread bkgnd compile interval</td><td>0;9</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>If compiling exams lists in the background, this field is used todefine the number of minutes to wait in between each successive compile ofthe UNREAD Exams List.  If not specified, the default value used will be 6minutes.For sites that tend to have more than 100 Unread exams on average, it is recommended to use a value of 3 or 4 minutes; less than 100, use 2 or 3minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>7.2</td><td>recent bkgnd compile interval</td><td>0;13</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The Recent List Background Compile is managed by Taskman, where aScheduled Option should be defined for periodically compiling this list(recommended to compile every two to three hours).  Use this field to letVistARad know what you have defined in TaskMan as the interval betweencompiles.  This value is used to provide a warning message to the VistaRaduser should it appear that the Background Compile has not run for morethan this expected interval of time.  Obviously, this field only is usefulif BACKGROUND COMPILE EXAM LISTS has been Enabled.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>remote list only remote cache?</td><td>0;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This question only applies to sites that use the Imaging Routing Gatewayto route images to a remote facility for reading. At the remote reading workstation, the Unread & Recent Exams lists maydisplay either all exams, or only the subset of the exams that have beenrouted to the remote site. Enter YES to display only the routed exams.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>site sends to remote cache</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This question only applies to sites that use the Imaging Routing Gatewayto route images to a remote facility for reading. Answering this question YES turns on extra processing that is neededto manage the remote exams properly in VistARad.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>patient list limit # years</td><td>0;14</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The Patient Exams List can display a subset of all a patient's exams,limited by how old the exams are.  This field is used to specify how farback in time the patient list should go before stopping.NOTE that the user does have a separate option to list ALL the patient'sexams, regardless of the setting of this field.NOT entering a value will force the Patient Exams List to go back to theearliest exams on record for a patient.  Greater efficiency in compilingthis list is achieved by limiting the number of years to a "most useful"value (clinically speaking).</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>patient list limit # exams</td><td>0;15</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The Patient Exams List can display a subset of all a patient's exams,limited by a maximum number of exams to display. This field is used tospecify the maximum to list before stopping.NOTE that the user does have a separate option to list ALL the patient'sexams, regardless of the setting of this field.NOT entering a value will force the Patient Exams List to list all examsin the defined time period for a patient.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>requisition for rad staff only</td><td>0;16</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:Y<br/></td><td></td><td>Setting this value to YES will prevent non-radiology personnel fromviewing the Radiology Requisition from Vistarad.Some sites have data that appears on the requisition which isstrictly for internal radiology staff use.  This prompt providesa way to restrict access to that report.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>ena dict pref-yes all locked</td><td>0;17</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This setting affects some behavior of VistARad's dictation systeminterface.  When a locked exam is opened, the accession number is sentacross the interface via the Dictation dialog.  Normally, whenever morethan one locked exam is opened, the dialog displays an entry for eachof the exams, and defaults YES (i.e. send the accession number across)for only one of the exams; the user may manually change the selectionfor any or all of the exams to YES if desired.  A user preference exists to allow the user to specify that ALL lockedexams in this dialog be defaulted to YES.  This preference is only enabled if a site-level policy is implemented to allow the use of thispreference.  Answering YES to the setting ENA DICT PREF-YES ALL LOCKEDimplements this site-level policy.  Each user then may choose toenable the preference--the system's default behavior is to disablethis preference.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>unread list priority seq</td><td>1;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The Unread lists show a column, PRIORITY, that is typically used as a sort item for the list.  Four values are possible (from the Radiology Examorder, file 75.1).  This field allows the site to define the preferredsort ordering for these 4 values.  The default order is:   Stat, Urgent, Pre-op, RoutineTo achieve this ordering, the value for this field would be specified:   S,U,P,RAny sequence of these 4 letters may be defined, and then will be used bythe list program.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
