Extract criteria is defined as "list rules" in thisfile. The file is used by the Reminder Patient List option and ReminderExtract Management option to create patient lists.  There are four types of rule criteria in the List Rule file:    Patient List - defines an existing patient list   Finding Rule  - defines reminder terms that specify findings                   and the date ranges to use  Reminder Rule - defines a reminder definition that builds a patient list                  based on the patient cohort logic using the ending date as                  the evaluation date.   Rule Set      - defines a multiple of sequentially defined list rules                   (a rule set can not be included in the multiple). The rule criteria are combined into a Rule Set that defines how to use thecriteria to create or modify a patient list. Rule Sets allow lists of patientsto be manipulated when a patient meets specified criteria by the followingoperations:    ADD     to a new or existing patient list   REMOVE   from an existing list   SELECT   retain a patient in an existing list if the patient meets the            criteria, and remove the patient if the patient does not meet            the criteria.   A rule set can contain multiple operations. One operation can be defined foreach sequence in the rule set.   Nationally distributed list rules are prefixed with 'VA-' and cannot bemodified by sites.  FINDING RULES and Date Ranges:------------------------------------------------------------A Date Range is used by FINDING RULES to search for findings.List build processing determines which Beginning Date/time and Ending Date/timeto use when evaluating each finding based on where the date/times are defined.Beginning Date/Time (BDT) and Ending Date/Time (EDT) fields can be defined atmultiple levels:1  List Build action BDT and EDT: default when not defined at lower level  2  Rule Set Sequence BDT and EDT: overrides previous level    3  List Rule BDT and EDT: overrides previous levels      4  Term Finding BDT and EDT: overrides previous levelsThis override relationship can be defined with the following equation, where"<" should be interpreted as "is overridden by":List Build < rule set sequence < list rule < term's findingList Build and date range evaluation:------------------------------------The List Build BDT and EDT are specified by the user selecting the List Buildaction. The List Build BDT and EDT is the default date range when the BDT andEDT are not defined for the rule set sequence, list rule, or term finding. Thedefault date range is used to find a match on each finding in the criteria. If no date range limits should be used to find a match on finding, either therule set sequence or list rule needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT orEDT fields, or both. A zero in the BDT field means start with the patient'soldest data. A zero in the EDT field represents the end of the day on the daythe list is built. Note: This is in contrast to Reminder Definitions, where theBDT and EDT for a finding are left blank to specify no limits. In the REMINDERLIST RULE file, if zero is defined in the BDT, and the EDT is left blank, thelist build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date rangelimits, and vice versa if EDT has the 0 and the BDT is blank. The use of "T" in the BDT or EDT fields always represents the List Build endingdate/time specified for the list build action or the extract reporting period,depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract option is being used tobuild the list."BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the startingdate/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period.BDT-5Y creates a date five years prior to the beginning date/time. If the ending date/time is earlier than the beginning date/time, then nofinding matches will be found.REMINDER RULES and Date Ranges:------------------------------------------------------------Reminder Rules do not use the Beginning Date/time from the List Build, ListRule Sequence or Reminder Rule Beginning Date/time fields. Reminder evaluationusing date ranges is based on existing reminder definitions. However, aReminder Rule will use the Ending Date/time (EDT) from the Reminder Rule, ListRule Sequence, or List Build EDT. The same EDT overrides that are used forFinding Rule EDT are also used for Reminder Rule. The EDT used for reminderevaluation can be defined at multiple levels:1  List Build action EDT: default when not defined at lower level  2  Rule Set Sequence EDT: overrides previous level    3  List Rule EDT: overrides previous levels      4  Reminder evaluation is not impacted by terms in the reminder         definition.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the list rule. National list rules are prefixed VA- and class national. </td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>short description</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a short description of the list rule.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>type(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:FINDING RULE<br/>3:RULE SET<br/>5:PATIENT LIST<br/>2:REMINDER RULE<br/></td><td></td><td>There are three types of rules in the file.

In order for patient data tomeet the List Finding Rule criteria, the findings must have beendocumented on or after the BDT. Reminder Rules and Patient List Rules do not use the Beginning date/timefield.  The BDT defined for a finding rule will be overridden if the term in thefinding rule has a mapped finding with a BDT or Ending Date/Time (EDT). The rules for overriding date ranges is represented by the followingequation, where "<" should be interpreted as "is overridden by":   Build < rule set sequence < list rule < term's finding If the BDT and EDT are not defined on the list rule set sequence, northe list finding rule, nor the Reminder Term's mapped finding, then thepatient list tools will use the List Build's date range to find amatch on findings. The List Build date range is the date rangespecified by the user when the list build action is selected. The listbuild date range is the Extract reporting period if an extract isbeing run. If no date range limits should be used to match findings for thisfinding rule, the finding rule needs to be defined with a zero in theBDT or EDT fields, or both. The term referenced in the list ruleshould not have BDT and EDT fields defined. If zero is defined in theBDT, and the EDT is left blank, the list build tools will assume bothBDT and EDT should not have date range limits, and vice versa if EDThas the 0 and the BDT is blank. The use of "T" in the finding rule BDT field will always represent theending date/time specified for the list build process or the extractreporting period, depending on whether a reminder patient list orextract option is being used to build the list. For example, T-1Y isone year prior to the list build's ending date/time. "BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents thebeginning date/time specified by the user processing the list buildaction. For example, BDT-5Y creates a beginning date for the listrule that is five years prior to the list build's beginning date/time. A fixed date may be defined in the BDT (e.g. 09/11/02). If the beginning date/time is later than the ending date/time, then nofinding matches will be found.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>list rule ending date/time</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter an exact date, symbolic date, or 0 (zero) for no ending date.Symbolic dates can use "T" to represent the build end date, or "BDT"for build beginning date. This field is the ending date/time to use when searching for findingsthat match this list rule criteria.

The existing patient list is used as the patient source to perform the ADD, SELECT, or REMOVE operation on the list rule.  The existing patientlist is used to modify the temporary patient list built duringlist build processing.   For the  ADD operation the patients in the source list will be  added to the temporary patient list.   For the SELECT operation, the patients in the source list will be   compared to the temporary patient list.  Patient's in the  temporary list that are not in the source list will be removed  from the temporary patient list.   For the REMOVE operation, the patients in the source list, that  match a patient in the temporary patient list will be removed  from the temporary patient list.   If the USE EXISTING PT LIST and USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED field  are both defined in the list rule, the USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED  will be used as the patient source for extract processing,  and the USE EXISTING PT LIST will be used when the build  processing is started from the Reminder Patient List option.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>use extract pt list named</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a free-text field that contains the name of the patient listto use when processing this list rule during an extract run. Thepatient list has not been created at the time the list rule isdefined. In contrast, the USE EXISTING PT LIST field is used bypatient list rule tools to reference a patient list alreadyexisting in the REMINDER PATIENT LIST file. The name specified in the USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED will contain'yyyy' for year and 'pnn' for reporting period. The nn is eitherthe month (01-12) or calendar quarter (01-04), and p is either Mfor monthly, Q for quarterly, or Y for yearly. When an extract is run for a particular reporting period, theextract tool will use the USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED to find thepatient list matching the name and then use this patient list tocreate the starting temporary patient list. The starting temporarypatient list will be modified by add, select, and delete operationsdefined in the remaining list rules defined in the rule set. The same extract patient list name is also named in the REMINDEREXTRACT DEFINITION file (#810.2). The extract definition is used tocreate the extract patient list during an extract run. The 'yyyy'and 'pnn' ensures the extract process for the reporting year andperiod consistently uses the appropriate extract patient listcreated for the reporting period. Example: The patient list 'VA-*IHD QUERI yyyy pnn PATIENTS WITHQUALIFYING VISIT' is created during 'VA-IHD QUERI' extractprocessing by a rule set defined in the extract definition. Then asubsequent rule set defined in the 'VA-IHD QUERI' extract definition references a REMINDER LIST RULE entry with the sameextract patient list name in the USE EXTRACT PT LIST NAMED field.During the extract run, the named list will be used to find thepatient list created during the extract run in process.  This listis used with the ADD operation in the rule set to create thetemporary patient list to process the remaining rules in the ruleset. In this example, the temorary patient list is  modified toinclude patients that have both a QUALIFYING VISIT and an ANCHORvisit, creating a new patient list, 'VA-*IHD QUERI yyyy nn PATIENTSWITH QUALIFYING AND ANCHOR VISIT'. The new patient list created by the rule set processing is defined in the extract definition.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>reminder definition</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="811_9.html">811.9</a></td><td></td><td>This is a pointer to the Reminder Definition file #811.9.
