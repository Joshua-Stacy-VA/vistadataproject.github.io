# Alert Tracking (8992.1)
This file is used to track the content and interactions with an alert. Every alert which is generated is initially filed within this file.  Each entry has the date and time the alert was generated, which user generated the alert, whether the alert was generated in a background task, what action was to be taken if any (the entry point or option name to be used) and the data string, if any, for use with the alert.  There is a multiple field which also identifies each user that the alert was sent to, and when the user initially saw the displayed text, when the alert was selected for processing, when the processing was completed, and when the alert was deleted after processing or associated with another user's processing, or when the alert was deleted by a clean-up operation.   Unless a longer lifetime is specified for the specific alert, it will be deleted from the file after 30 days.  If a longer lifetime is specified, it will not be deleted until after that period passes.

#### Properties

Label/Field Name | Field # | Description | Datatype | Attributes | Range
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Recipient Type**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  recipient_type</code></pre>{:/} | .01 | This field is used to track how a specific recipient was selected for <br/>receiving the alert. The initial recipients are those to whom the alert<br/>was initially directed (INITIAL RECIPIENT).  Other recipients may be the<br/>result of forwarding.  Recipients of the alert from forwarding are noted<br/>by the type of forwarding involved (FWD BY USER, EMAIL SURROGATE,<br/>CHIEF/SUPERVISOR, BACKUP REVIEWER, or LAST HOPE).<br/> <br/>Marked as a specific category are those to whom the alert was directed,<br/>but who were not available to receive an alert due to lack of access<br/>(marked with the suffix "-UNDELIVERABLE" added to the basis for the <br/>alert being sent to the user).<br/> <br/>Those who have alerts forwarded to their surrogate or receive the alert <br/>while acting as a surrogate for another user are indicated by entries in <br/>fields #.02 (SENT TO SURROGATE) and #.03 (ACTING AS SURROGATE), <br/>respectively.  In addition, those who are acting as surrogates are <br/>identified in the current field by the suffix "-SURROGATE" added to the <br/>basis for the alert being received.  Since the recipient may be acting as <br/>surrogate for more than one user, the actual users for which the message <br/>was sent on a surrogate basis are indicated in the SURROGATE FOR sub-file <br/>(#8992.113) under the RECIPIENT sub-file.<br/> <br/>The values stored for this field are pointers to entries in the ALERT <br/>RECIPIENT TYPE file (#8992.2). | POINTER | INDEXED<br/>REQUIRED | Alert_Recipient_Type-8992_2
**Sent To Surrogate**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  sent_to_surrogate</code></pre>{:/} | .02 | This field is used to identify the surrogate to whom the alert<br/>was sent instead of this originally specified recipient. | POINTER |  | [New_Person-200](New_Person-200)
**Acting As Surrogate**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  acting_as_surrogate</code></pre>{:/} | .03 | This field is used to identify those recipients who were sent the alert <br/>because they were selected as an active surrogate for the originally <br/>intended user.  In most cases only the Y (YES) entries will be entered. | BOOLEAN |  | {::nomarkdown}false: <em><strong>N</strong></em><br/>true: <em><strong>Y</strong></em>{:/}
**Alert Date/time**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  alert_date_time</code></pre>{:/} | .04 | This is the date and time the alert was sent/forwarded to the <br/>current recipient with this recipient type | DATE-TIME |  |

**Forwarded Date/time**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  forwarded_date_time</code></pre>{:/} | .01 | This field is used to track the date/time of forwarding of the alert to <br/>this recipient.  This is a multiple field to track instances in which <br/>multiple copies of the alert may be forwarded to a single recipient for<br/>various reasons.  This multiple field will indicate when it was forwarded<br/>and the basis for forwarding of the alert. | DATE-TIME | INDEXED<br/>REQUIRED | 
**Forwarding Category**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  forwarding_category</code></pre>{:/} | .02 | This field is used to track the basis on which the alert is forwarded to <br/>the current recipient.  The alert might be forwarded to the recipient by <br/>a user directly, or by programmed forwarding related to alerts not being <br/>processed within a specified time to EMAIL SURROGATE, CHIEF/SUPERVISOR; <br/>BACKUP REVIEWER, or LAST RESORT.<br/> <br/>Entries for this field are pointers to the values in the ALERT RECIPIENT <br/>TYPE file (#8992.2). | POINTER |  | Alert_Recipient_Type-8992_2
**Forwarded By Or For**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  forwarded_by_or_for</code></pre>{:/} | .03 | This is a record of the individual who forwarded the alert, or on whose <br/>behalf the alert was forwarded if it was forwarded automatically. | POINTER |  | [New_Person-200](New_Person-200)
**Forwarding Comment**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  forwarding_comment</code></pre>{:/} | 1.01 | This is the comment which was sent to the recipient along with the <br/>forwarded alert. | STRING |  |

**Date/time - Surrogate For**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  date_time__surrogate_for</code></pre>{:/} | .02 | This field has the date/time when the alert was sent to the current <br/>recipient while acting as a surrogate for the originally intended <br/>recipient. | DATE-TIME |  | 
**Date-time Returned**{::nomarkdown}<pre><code>  datetime_returned</code></pre>{:/} | .03 | This field is a record for the date-time that an alert for which this <br/>recipient was acting as a surrogate was returned to the originally <br/>intended recipient of the alert. | DATE-TIME |  |
