#### [Developer Documentation](../index) &#187; [Parameters](TableOfContents) &#187; DSIV DOCMAN VI DELETE<br/>
# DSIV DOCMAN VI DELETE

The parameter controls whether or not the site wants the import image file deleted from the network directory by the VistA Imaging Background Processor after the BP has imported the file.  The BP will delete the file if told to do so whether or not it successfully imports the image.  The usual exception to this occurs when the BP process does not RWD rights to the folder where the image resides.
