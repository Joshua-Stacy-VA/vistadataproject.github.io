#### [Developer Documentation](../index) &#187; [Parameters](TableOfContents) &#187; PSB RPT MAX RANGE<br/>
# PSB RPT MAX RANGE

PSB RPT MAX RANGE is to support the sites ability to limit the range of days a BCMA report will be allowed to process.  For example, when this parameter is set to 7 , a BCMA report will be able to process data in a range of 7 days such as Jan 1 - Jan 8, 2007.  This will assist in limiting the allocation of resources when processing a BCMA report.
