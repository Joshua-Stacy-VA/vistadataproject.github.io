# ORAM INR QUICK ORDER

This is the reference to the Quick Order Dialog for the INR (InternationalNormalized Ratio) for Prothrombin Times.                                 INR: International normalized ratio, a system established by the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) and the International Committee on Thrombosisand Hemostasis for reporting the results of blood coagulation (clotting)tests. All results are standardized using the international sensitivityindex for the particular thromboplastin reagent and instrument combinationutilized to perform the test.                                 For example, a person taking the anticoagulant (&quot;blood thinner&quot;) warfarin(brand name: Coumadin) might optimally maintain a prothrombin time (a &quot;protime&quot; or PT) of 2 to 3 INR. No matter what laboratory checks theprothrombin time, the result should be the same even if differentthromboplastins and instruments are used. This internationalstandardization permits the patient on warfarin to travel and still obtaincomparable test results.
