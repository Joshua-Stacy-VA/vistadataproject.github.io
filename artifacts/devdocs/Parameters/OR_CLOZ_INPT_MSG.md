## [Parameters](TableOfContents) &#8594; OR CLOZ INPT MSG
# OR CLOZ INPT MSG

This parameter allows sites to set what text they would like for users to see when an inpatient order of Clozapine is made.  This drug is generally ordered in an outpatient setting and thus is subject to the special order appropriateness checks.  However, when ordered in an inpatient setting these checks are not done.  Thus sites should determine a policy to handle this and provide instructions to users based on that policy.
