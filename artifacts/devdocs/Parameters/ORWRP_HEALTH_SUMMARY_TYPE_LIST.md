# ORWRP HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE LIST

Health Summary types that may be displayed by the CPRS GUI should beentered here.  Only health summaries that do no additional promptingmay be selected (i.e., all time and occurrence limits must be alreadydefined).  The exception to this is the Adhoc Health Summary (GMTS HSADHOC OPTION).  The Adhoc is a special case that is handled bythe GUI.
