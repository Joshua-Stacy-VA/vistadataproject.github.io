 description | {::nomarkdown}This file contains Clinical Reminder definitions. For a detailed<br/>description of the contents of this file, see the Clinical Reminders<br/>Manager Manual. Additional information may be found at the Clinical<br/>Reminders web site: http//vista.domain.ext/reminders<br/><br/>This file contains a combination of nationally distributed and local<br/>entries. Any local entries are assigned an internal entry number<br/>prefixed with your site number. Nationally distributed entries have<br/>their name prefixed with VA-. Local entry names cannot start with VA-.{:/}

| name | .01 | Name | {::nomarkdown}This field is the name of a clinical reminder definition. Nationally<br/>distributed reminder definition names are prefixed with \VA-\. The<br/>VA- prefixed reminder definitions cannot be altered by a site, but<br/>may be inactivated so they will not be selectable or evaluated in<br/>the CPRS GUI.<br/> <br/>Local modifications can be made to any \VA-\ reminder definition by<br/>copying the definition to a new one with a unique name and then<br/>making modifications to the new definition which meet local<br/>criteria.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED |  | 
| print_name | 1.2 | Print Name | {::nomarkdown}This is the name that is used when the results of a reminder evaluation<br/>are displayed.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| do_in_advance_time_frame | 1.3 | Do In Advance Time Frame | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to let a reminder become due earlier than the<br/>date determined by adding the frequency to the date when the<br/>reminder was last resolved. For example, if the frequency is 1Y (one<br/>year) and the DO IN ADVANCE TIME FRAME is 1M (one month), the<br/>reminder would have a status of \DUE SOON\ 11 months after it was<br/>last resolved. After one year has passed, the STATUS would be \DUE\.<br/><br/>Frequencies have the form IU where I is an integer and U is one of<br/>the following units: H (hours), D (days), W (weeks), M (months), and<br/>Y (years).<br/>{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

| inactive_flag | 1.6 | Inactive Flag | {::nomarkdown}Reminders that are inactive will not be evaluated. The Clinical<br/>Maintenance component will return a message stating the reminder is<br/>inactive and the date when it was made inactive.<br/><br/>Other applications that use reminders may use this flag to determine<br/>if a reminder can be selected for inclusion.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>1</dt><dd>INACTIVE</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| inactive_change_date | 1.7 | Inactive Change Date | {::nomarkdown}This is the date and time when the INACTIVE FLAG was last changed. It<br/>is set automatically. Users should never edit this field.{:/} | DATE-TIME |  |  |  | 
| ignore_on_n_a | 1.8 | Ignore On N/a | {::nomarkdown}This field allows the user to stop reminders from being printed in<br/>the Clinical Maintenance component if the reminder is N/A. This is a<br/>free text field that can contain any combination of the following<br/>codes:<br/> <br/>Code  Description<br/> A    N/A due to not meeting age criteria.<br/> I    N/A due to inactive reminder.<br/> R    N/A due to the wrong race.<br/> S    N/A due to the wrong sex.<br/> *    N/A for any reason.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| sex_specific | 1.9 | Sex Specific | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to make a reminder sex specific. If an \F\ is<br/>entered, the reminder applies only to females. If an \M\ is entered,<br/>the reminder applies only to males. If it is left blank, then the<br/>reminder is applicable to either sex.<br/><br/>If CUSTOM COHORT LOGIC is defined and it does not contain SEX, then<br/>this field will be ignored.<br/>{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>M</dt><dd>MALE</dd><dt>F</dt><dd>FEMALE</dd></dl>{:/} |

| baseline_age_findings | 7 | Baseline Age Findings | {::nomarkdown}This multiple is for defining reminder frequency age ranges sets. It<br/>can be used to specify different frequencies for different ages. For<br/>example, you could define a frequency of every 3 years for ages 40<br/>to 49 as the first age range set, a frequency of every 2 years for<br/>ages 50 to 59 as the second, and a frequency of once a year for ages<br/>60 to 75. With this set the reminder would be due every 3 years for<br/>ages 40 to 49, every 2 years for ages 50 to 59, and once a year for<br/>ages 60 to 75.{:/} | [OBJECT] |  |  | [Baseline_Age_Findings-811_97](#Baseline_Age_Findings-811_97)  | 
| findings | 20 | Findings | {::nomarkdown}This multiple identifies which finding items to use when evaluating the<br/>reminder. Finding items may be categorized into 4 types of findings:<br/>age, patient cohort, resolution, and informational. How patient findings<br/>are used depends on the values given to the various fields associated with <br/>findings. See the description of those fields to learn what they do.{:/} | [OBJECT] |  |  | [Findings-811_902](#Findings-811_902)  | 
| function_findings | 25 | Function Findings | {::nomarkdown}This multiple is used to define function findings; each function<br/>finding is labeled by an integer: the FUNCTION FINDING NUMBER. The<br/>user defines a function finding by inputting a FUNCTION FINDING<br/>NUMBER and associated FUNCTION STRING. Function Findings are then<br/>used in the reminder definition logic by reference to FF(FUNCTION<br/>FINDING NUMBER). For example, if function findings 1 and 2 were<br/>defined, then they could be used in the cohort or resolution logic as<br/>FF(1) and FF(2).<br/><br/>Function findings can be used in the resolution logic with one<br/>caveat. They do not have a date associated with them; therefore, the<br/>resolution logic must be written so that it cannot be made true<br/>solely by a function finding.{:/} | [OBJECT] |  |  | [Function_Findings-811_925](#Function_Findings-811_925)  | 
| customized_cohort_logic | 30 | Customized Cohort Logic | {::nomarkdown}This field may be used to define a customized Patient Cohort Logic<br/>string. Typically this is done when the USE IN PATIENT COHORT LOGIC<br/>fields associated with each finding do not provide the ability to<br/>create the required logic string. The requirement for custom logic<br/>arises when the required logic is more complex than can be<br/>represented by simple concatenation of Boolean logical operators and<br/>findings.<br/><br/>Detailed information on how to create the custom logic string can be<br/>found in the Clinical Reminders Manager Manual.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

Typically this is done when the USE IN RESOLUTION LOGIC<br/>fields associated with each finding do not provide the ability to<br/>create the required logic string. The requirement for custom logic<br/>arises when the required logic is more complex than can be<br/>represented by simple concatenation of Boolean logical operators and<br/>findings.<br/><br/>Detailed information on how to create the custom logic string can be<br/>found in the Clinical Reminders Manager Manual.<br/>{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

| custom_date_due | 45 | Custom Date Due | {::nomarkdown}When a CUSTOM DATE DUE is defined, it takes precedence over the<br/>standard date due calculation. This means the normal date due<br/>calculation that is based on the dates of the resolution findings<br/>and the final frequency is not done. Only the dates of the findings<br/>and the frequencies specified in the Custom Date Due string are<br/>used. Any finding that is in the reminder definition can be used in<br/>the Custom Date Due string; it is not limited to those defined as<br/>resolution findings.<br/><br/>The final age range will still be used to determine if the patient<br/>is in the cohort; however, the frequency associated with this age<br/>range is not used. Only the frequencies specified in the Custom Date<br/>Due String are used. They are added to the date of the associated<br/>finding to determine the dates used by either the MIN_DATE or<br/>MAX_DATE functions.<br/>{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

The list of web sites will be displayed in the CPRS<br/>GUI if the user right-clicks on a reminder and then selects<br/>reference information.
