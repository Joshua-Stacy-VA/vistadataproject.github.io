 location | ^XTV(8992.1,
 description | {::nomarkdown}This file is used to track the content and interactions with an alert.<br/>Every alert which is generated is initially filed within this file.  Each<br/>entry has the date and time the alert was generated, which user generated<br/>the alert, whether the alert was generated in a background task, what<br/>action was to be taken if any (the entry point or option name to be used)<br/>and the data string, if any, for use with the alert.  There is a multiple<br/>field which also identifies each user that the alert was sent to, and when<br/>the user initially saw the displayed text, when the alert was selected for<br/>processing, when the processing was completed, and when the alert was<br/>deleted after processing or associated with another user's processing, or<br/>when the alert was deleted by a clean-up operation.<br/> <br/>Unless a longer lifetime is specified for the specific alert, it will be<br/>deleted from the file after 30 days.  If a longer lifetime is specified,<br/>it will not be deleted until after that period passes.{:/}
