 description | This file contains patient specific problems entered by the various\rproviders of service.  The PATIENT NAME field (.02) is a backward pointer\rto the IHS PATIENT file.  This file contains one record for each problem\rfor each patient, therefore, the KEY field (.01) is duplicated.\r \rAs of March 17, 1986 the FACILITY must be entered prior to the NUMBER.\rIf the NUMBER is entered without previously entering the FACILITY the\r\AA\ index is created with no FACILITY pointer.

| snomed_ct_concept_code | 80001 | Snomed Ct Concept Code | A clinical idea to which a unique ConceptID has been assigned in SNOMED\rCT. Each Concept is represented by a row in the Concepts Table. | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| snomed_ct_designation_code | 80002 | Snomed Ct Designation Code | A single SNOMED Concept may have multiple Designations, where a \rDesignation may be considered an alternate way of expressing the concept. \rSynonyms, lexical variants, abbreviations are all different types of \rdesignations. In many cases, a problem (as reported by the patient) and a \rfinding indicating a problem will share the same concept and concept code \r(e.g., abdominal pain), but will have different designation codes (i.e., \rthe generic \abdominal pain  and \abdominal pain (finding)  share the \rconcept code 21522001, but they have the designation codes 36112013 and \r750827015 respectively. | STRING |  |  |  | 
| vhat_concept_vuid_future | 80003 | Vhat Concept VUID (future) | VHA Unique ID (VUID) for the VHAT Concept. A unique meaningless integer\rassigned to a corresponding concept VHA wide.\r \rThis field is being implemented to allow a more rapidly extensible \rvocabulary for VA, while international normative standard coding systems \rcontinue to evolve more slowly. The precise definition of the concept \rPolytrauma may prove to be a useful example. Although the term has \rbecome common among US Military and VA physicians to describe a seriously \rinjured (i.e., Injury Severity Score (ISS) >= 16) soldier with multiple \rtraumatic injuries, it is not yet available as a coded concept in either\rSNOMED CT, ICD-9-CM, or ICD-10-CM. Allowing the definition and deployment\rof VHAT Concept/Designation VUID pairs to identify such problems in\radvance of their acceptance by the international medical community will\rhelp to provide coded, computable documentation in a much more timely\rmanner than waiting for inclusion in SNOMED CT or ICD.\r \rWhen the infrastructure in VA's Enterprise Terminology Server (ETS) & New\rTerm Rapid Turn-around (NTRT) service are ready to deploy VHAT Concepts, \rthis field will allow us to store patient problems encoded with them. | STRING |  |  |  | 
| vhat_designation_vuid_future | 80004 | Vhat Designation VUID (future) | VHA Unique ID (VUID) for the VHAT Designation. A unique meaningless\rinteger assigned to a corresponding designation VHA wide.\r \rVHAT Concept/Designation Code pairs function in a manner identical to \rthat of SNOMED CT Concept/Designation Codes (i.e., they support the \runique identification of clinical concepts, along with the many \ralternative ways in which a given concept may be expressed). | STRING |  |  |  | 
| snomed_cttoicd_map_status | 80005 | Snomed Ct-to-icd Map Status | This Set of Codes type field is set to PENDING when an unmapped Clinical\rFinding is selected as a patient's problem. It is updated programmatically\rto COMPLETE when NTRT deploys a new SNOMED CT to ICD mapping for \rthe problem in question.\r \rNOTE: THIS FIELD SHOULD NEVER BE UPDATED BY AN END USER. | ENUMERATION |  |  | <dl><dt>2</dt><dd>COMPLETED</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>N/A</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>PENDING</dd></dl> | 
| unique_new_term_requested | 80101 | Unique New Term Requested | Indicates whether the user requested a new term during the process of \rentering a freetext problem. It should only be populated automatically by \rprogram code. \r \rNOTE: THIS FIELD SHOULD NEVER BE UPDATED BY AN END USER. | ENUMERATION |  |  | <dl><dt>1</dt><dd>True</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>False</dd></dl> | 
| unique_term_request_comment | 80102 | Unique Term Request Comment | Please provide clarification of the new term request. For example, if the\rrequested term is an acronym or abbreviation, the comment field \raccommodates the fully specified name, etc. | STRING |  |  |  | 
| date_of_interest | 80201 | Date Of Interest | This is the date when the DIAGNOSIS (#.01) and CODING SYSTEM (#80202) \rfields were filed or modified. This allows proper resolution of the code, \rirrespective of code set versions, etc.   | DATE-TIME |  |  |  | 
| coding_system | 80202 | Coding System | This identifies the Coding System to which the Code belongs. It \rcorresponds to the Coding System Abbreviation in the ICD Coding Systems \rFile, to optimize internal/external API calls for resolving codes, \rindependent of their code set version, and to facilitate transition from \rICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM.\r \rExamples include:\r \rCODING SYS \r  ABBREV       NOMENCLATURE    ICD FILE\r---------------------------------------------\r   10D          ICD-10-CM      ICD Diagnosis\r   ICD          ICD-9-CM       ICD Diagnosis  | STRING |  |  |  | 
| mapping_targets | 80300 | Mapping Targets | This multiple includes mapped expressions: complications, comorbidities,\rand compound diagnoses. e.g., the single SNOMED CT concept Diabetic\rneuropathy (230572002) is mapped to two ICD-9-CM diagnoses: DIABETES WITH\rNEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS, TYPE II OR UNSPECIFIED TYPE, NOT STATED AS\rUNCONTROLLED (250.60) and POLYNEUROPATHY IN DIABETES (357.2). | [OBJECT] |  |  | [Mapping_Targets-9000011_803](#mapping_targets-9000011_803)  |
