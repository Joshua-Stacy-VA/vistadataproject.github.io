<dt>description</dt><dd>}This file contains patient specific problems entered by the various<br/>providers of service.  The PATIENT NAME field (.02) is a backward pointer<br/>to the IHS PATIENT file.  This file contains one record for each problem<br/>for each patient, therefore, the KEY field (.01) is duplicated.<br/> <br/>As of March 17, 1986 the FACILITY must be entered prior to the NUMBER.<br/>If the NUMBER is entered without previously entering the FACILITY the<br/>\AA\ index is created with no FACILITY pointer.</dd>

| snomed_ct_concept_code | 80001 | Snomed Ct Concept Code | {::nomarkdown}A clinical idea to which a unique ConceptID has been assigned in SNOMED<br/>CT. Each Concept is represented by a row in the Concepts Table.{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| snomed_ct_designation_code | 80002 | Snomed Ct Designation Code | {::nomarkdown}A single SNOMED Concept may have multiple Designations, where a <br/>Designation may be considered an alternate way of expressing the concept. <br/>Synonyms, lexical variants, abbreviations are all different types of <br/>designations. In many cases, a problem (as reported by the patient) and a <br/>finding indicating a problem will share the same concept and concept code <br/>(e.g., abdominal pain), but will have different designation codes (i.e., <br/>the generic \abdominal pain  and \abdominal pain (finding)  share the <br/>concept code 21522001, but they have the designation codes 36112013 and <br/>750827015 respectively.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| vhat_concept_vuid_future | 80003 | Vhat Concept VUID (future) | {::nomarkdown}VHA Unique ID (VUID) for the VHAT Concept. A unique meaningless integer<br/>assigned to a corresponding concept VHA wide.<br/> <br/>This field is being implemented to allow a more rapidly extensible <br/>vocabulary for VA, while international normative standard coding systems <br/>continue to evolve more slowly. The precise definition of the concept <br/>Polytrauma may prove to be a useful example. Although the term has <br/>become common among US Military and VA physicians to describe a seriously <br/>injured (i.e., Injury Severity Score (ISS) >= 16) soldier with multiple <br/>traumatic injuries, it is not yet available as a coded concept in either<br/>SNOMED CT, ICD-9-CM, or ICD-10-CM. Allowing the definition and deployment<br/>of VHAT Concept/Designation VUID pairs to identify such problems in<br/>advance of their acceptance by the international medical community will<br/>help to provide coded, computable documentation in a much more timely<br/>manner than waiting for inclusion in SNOMED CT or ICD.<br/> <br/>When the infrastructure in VA's Enterprise Terminology Server (ETS) & New<br/>Term Rapid Turn-around (NTRT) service are ready to deploy VHAT Concepts, <br/>this field will allow us to store patient problems encoded with them.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| vhat_designation_vuid_future | 80004 | Vhat Designation VUID (future) | {::nomarkdown}VHA Unique ID (VUID) for the VHAT Designation. A unique meaningless<br/>integer assigned to a corresponding designation VHA wide.<br/> <br/>VHAT Concept/Designation Code pairs function in a manner identical to <br/>that of SNOMED CT Concept/Designation Codes (i.e., they support the <br/>unique identification of clinical concepts, along with the many <br/>alternative ways in which a given concept may be expressed).{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| snomed_cttoicd_map_status | 80005 | Snomed Ct-to-icd Map Status | {::nomarkdown}This Set of Codes type field is set to PENDING when an unmapped Clinical<br/>Finding is selected as a patient's problem. It is updated programmatically<br/>to COMPLETE when NTRT deploys a new SNOMED CT to ICD mapping for <br/>the problem in question.<br/> <br/>NOTE: THIS FIELD SHOULD NEVER BE UPDATED BY AN END USER.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>2</dt><dd>COMPLETED</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>N/A</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>PENDING</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| unique_new_term_requested | 80101 | Unique New Term Requested | {::nomarkdown}Indicates whether the user requested a new term during the process of <br/>entering a freetext problem. It should only be populated automatically by <br/>program code. <br/> <br/>NOTE: THIS FIELD SHOULD NEVER BE UPDATED BY AN END USER.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>1</dt><dd>True</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>False</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| unique_term_request_comment | 80102 | Unique Term Request Comment | {::nomarkdown}Please provide clarification of the new term request. For example, if the<br/>requested term is an acronym or abbreviation, the comment field <br/>accommodates the fully specified name, etc.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| date_of_interest | 80201 | Date Of Interest | {::nomarkdown}This is the date when the DIAGNOSIS (#.01) and CODING SYSTEM (#80202) <br/>fields were filed or modified. This allows proper resolution of the code, <br/>irrespective of code set versions, etc.  {:/} | DATE-TIME |  |  |  | 
| coding_system | 80202 | Coding System | {::nomarkdown}This identifies the Coding System to which the Code belongs. It <br/>corresponds to the Coding System Abbreviation in the ICD Coding Systems <br/>File, to optimize internal/external API calls for resolving codes, <br/>independent of their code set version, and to facilitate transition from <br/>ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM.<br/> <br/>Examples include:<br/> <br/>CODING SYS <br/>  ABBREV       NOMENCLATURE    ICD FILE<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>   10D          ICD-10-CM      ICD Diagnosis<br/>   ICD          ICD-9-CM       ICD Diagnosis {:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| mapping_targets | 80300 | Mapping Targets | {::nomarkdown}This multiple includes mapped expressions: complications, comorbidities,<br/>and compound diagnoses. e.g., the single SNOMED CT concept Diabetic<br/>neuropathy (230572002) is mapped to two ICD-9-CM diagnoses: DIABETES WITH<br/>NEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS, TYPE II OR UNSPECIFIED TYPE, NOT STATED AS<br/>UNCONTROLLED (250.60) and POLYNEUROPATHY IN DIABETES (357.2).{:/} | [OBJECT] |  |  | [Mapping_Targets-9000011_803](#Mapping_Targets-9000011_803)  |
