<dt>description</dt><dd>}This file is used to define all of the components that work together to <br/>define a reminder dialog. Reminder dialog definitions are used by the CPRS <br/>GUI for reminder resolution.  <br/> <br/>This file contains a combination of nationally distributed entries, local <br/>auto-generated entries, site and VISN exchanged entries and local manually <br/>created entries. Nationally distributed dialog, element, and group <br/>entries have their name prefixed with VA-. Nationally distributed Prompts, <br/>Forced Value, Result Groups, and Result Elements have their name prefixed <br/>with PXRM. Entries in this file may be auto-generated via the Dialog <br/>Management Menu option. Manually created dialog entries should use local <br/>namespacing conventions. Nationally distributed entries will have their <br/>class type defined as National. Entries created at the VISN level should be <br/>defined as VISN and entries created at a site should be defined as Local.  <br/> <br/>This file is similar to the option file where there are different types of <br/>entries (reminder dialog, dialog elements (sentences), prompts, and groups <br/>of elements, result elements and groups of result elements). Where an option <br/>has menu items, the dialog file has components that are entered, with the <br/>sequence field as the .01 field. <br/> <br/>A prompt is defined for PCE prompts, WH Notification Purpose, or as locally <br/>created comment check-boxes. The prompts will not have any components within <br/>them. PXRM-prefixed prompts are distributed in this file with the Clinical <br/>Reminder package.  <br/> <br/>A dialog element is defined primarily to represent sentences to display in <br/>the CPRS window with a check-box. When the user checks the sentence off, the<br/>FINDING ITEM in the dialog element and the ADDITIONAL FINDINGS will be added <br/>to the list of PCE updates, orders, WH Notification Purposes, and mental <br/>health tests. The updates won't occur on the CPRS GUI until the user clicks <br/>on the FINISH button. Dialog elements may have components added to them. <br/>Auto-generated components will be based on the additional prompts defined in <br/>the Finding Type Parameters. Once a dialog element is auto-generated, the <br/>sites can modify them.  <br/> <br/>Dialog elements may also be instructional text or a header. The FINDING ITEM <br/>and components would not be defined in dialog elements.  <br/> <br/>A dialog group is similar to menu options. It groups dialog elements and <br/>dialog groups within its component multiple. The dialog group can be defined <br/>with a finding item and a check-box. The components in the group can be <br/>hidden from the CPRS GUI window until the dialog group is checked off. <br/> <br/>A result element contains special logic that uses information entered during <br/>the resolution process to create a sentence to add to the progress note. The <br/>special logic contains a CONDITION that, when true, will use the ALTERNATE <br/>PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field to update the progress note. A separate result <br/>element is used for each separate sentence needed. The result element is <br/>only used with mental health test finding items. Default result elements are <br/>distributed for common mental health tests, prefixed with PXRM and the <br/>mental health test name. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions <br/>as needed.  <br/> <br/>A result group contains all of the result elements that need to be checked <br/>to create sentences for one mental health test finding. The dialog element <br/>for the test will have its RESULT GROUP/ELEMENT field defined with the <br/>result group. Default result groups for mental health tests are distributed <br/>with the Clinical Reminders package. Sites may copy them and modify their local <br/>versions as needed.  <br/><br/>Sites should name locally created items according to their local naming <br/>convention.</dd>

### Properties

| id | fmId | label | description | datatype | location | attributes | range | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| name | .01 | Name | {::nomarkdown}This is the name of the dialog entry. <br/><br/>Dialogs that are auto-generated from a reminder will default to the name of <br/>the reminder for ease in identifying the reminder dialog entry. Dialog <br/>elements that are auto-generated use the following naming convention:  <br/>Finding type prefix_ _Name from finding file_ _Resolution Status. Examples <br/>of two dialog element entry names generated from an Exam file entry for <br/>DIABETIC EYE EXAM follow.  <br/><br/>EX DIABETIC EYE EXAM DONE <br/>EX DIABETIC EYE EXAM DONE ELSEWHERE <br/>                                 <br/>Any item created locally can use any type of naming convention. Your site <br/>may want to create special namespacing for dialog entries that you create <br/>locally. <br/><br/>Entries prefixed with PXRM are prompts, result groups, and result elements <br/>that were distributed with the Clinical Reminders package. The PXRM-prefixed <br/>prompts are the additional prompts that can be asked for particular types of <br/>PCE findings and WH Notification Purpose. For example: PXRM COMMENT can be <br/>added to any PCE file to allow the user to enter an additional COMMENT <br/>beyond the dialog element's progress note text, and the PXRM LEVEL OF <br/>UNDERSTANDING can only be used with PCE Education Topic findings.  {:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED |  | 
| source_reminder | 2 | Source Reminder | {::nomarkdown}This identifies which reminder definition is associated with this<br/>\Reminder Dialog\ entry.  \Reminder Dialog\ type entries are the only<br/>entries that require this field.{:/} | POINTER |  | INDEXED | Reminder_Definition-811_9 | 
| disable | 3 | Disable | {::nomarkdown}This field disables the use of a dialog item. If a dialog item is<br/>marked as DISABLE AND SEND MESSAGE and a user tries to use it in<br/>CPRS, a message will be sent to the Clinical Reminders mail group.<br/>{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>2</dt><dd>DISABLE AND DO NOT SEND MESSAGE</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>DISABLE AND SEND MESSAGE</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>NO</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| type-4 | 4 | Type | {::nomarkdown}This field defines what type of dialog component this entry is. The<br/>type determines the processing that can occur with this entry. <br/> <br/>Reminder dialogs are the dialog entries that can be mapped to a<br/>reminder definition. Reminder dialogs will typically contain several<br/>dialog elements and/or dialog groups. <br/> <br/>Dialog elements that are auto-generated represent a finding item and<br/>resolution status combination, based on the Finding Type Parameters for<br/>auto-generation. The dialog elements can be defined manually if<br/>needed. Dialog elements must have the FINDING ITEM field defined in<br/>order to cause the finding to be updated automatically. When no<br/>finding item is defined, the dialog element is treated as a header or<br/>instruction text in the CPRS GUI. Sites can also add Additional Finding<br/>items to automatically update when a dialog element is checked off. An<br/>example of using the additional finding would be for a dialog element<br/>for a diagnosis, that must always be recorded with a second diagnosis.<br/>Another example is when an Exam or Education Topic dialog element<br/>checked off should automatically add an additional ICD9 and/or CPT<br/>finding to PCE.<br/> <br/>Dialog elements will use the DIALOG/PROGRESS NOTE TEXT to display in<br/>the CPRS GUI window. This text will also be added to the progress note,<br/>unless the optional ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field is defined. If<br/>the dialog text to display to the user needs to be different from the<br/>text to add to the progress note, use the ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT<br/>field to define the progress note text.<br/> <br/>Dialog Groups can be used to group dialog elements together. Groups<br/>can be displayed with a box around them and have selection rules<br/>applied to them (e.g., select one, one or more)  A dialog element can<br/>be changed to a dialog group by changing its TYPE.<br/>Prompts are distributed in the PXRM namespace to represent additional<br/>fields that the user can enter when an element is checked off. Prompts<br/>are added to dialog elements during auto-generation based on the<br/>finding type parameters. The PXRM COMMENT field is a generic comment<br/>field that can be used on all PCE related finding items. Dialog<br/>elements for \DONE ELSEWHERE\ need to require the historical visit date<br/>prompt. The forced value is similar to a prompt, except it represents<br/>a stuffed prompt which doesn't need to be presented to answer. The PXRM<br/>prompts can be copied for local modification to create additional<br/>forced value entries if necessary.<br/> <br/>Prompts created locally (not copies of PXRM prompts) are treated as<br/>display text with checkboxes, which, when checked off, add text to a<br/>comment field which is added to the progress note text. Refer to these<br/>as Local Comment Prompts.<br/> <br/>Result Groups and Result Elements are distributed in the PXRM namespace<br/>and are associated with Mental Health Instrument finding items during<br/>auto-generation of a reminder dialog. When the mental health instrument<br/>finding item dialog element is selected by the CPRS GUI user, a window<br/>will be opened which contains the test's questions and probable answers.<br/>The selected answers are sent to the mental health package when the<br/>user selects OK. The mental health package returns the score and<br/>results which can be used within sentences. These sentences are defined<br/>as Result Elements, and can vary depending on the test score. If<br/>multiple sentences are possible depending on the score, the result<br/>elements should be defined in a result group. The result group should<br/>be added to the mental health test's dialog elements RESULT<br/>GROUP/ELEMENT field. Mental Health tests for use by Mental Health<br/>clinicians only are not available for CPRS reminder resolution.<br/> <br/>A reminder dialog can be made into a dialog group and added to another<br/>reminder's dialog. This allows multiple reminders to be addressed by<br/>one reminder dialog.<br/> <br/>Reminder Dialogs can include dialog elements that don't have anything<br/>to do with the findings defined in the reminder.<br/> <br/>Taxonomy dialogs are auto-generated based on the Taxonomy Dialog<br/>Parameters. The taxonomy dialog can be used as a black box that allows<br/>the users to enter current or historical encounter diagnoses or<br/>procedures, based on the selectable list of diagnosis parameters. <br/>Alternatively, a taxonomy can have individual dialog elements created<br/>for each coded value in the selectable list of diagnoses and<br/>procedures. It may be more useful for sites to create dialog elements<br/>for the common diagnoses and procedures they actively use and add them<br/>to groups, similar to the encounter form section and coded value<br/>groupings.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>P</dt><dd>prompt</dd><dt>S</dt><dd>result group</dd><dt>F</dt><dd>forced value</dd><dt>T</dt><dd>result element</dd><dt>E</dt><dd>dialog element</dd><dt>R</dt><dd>reminder dialog</dd><dt>G</dt><dd>dialog group</dd></dl>{:/} |
