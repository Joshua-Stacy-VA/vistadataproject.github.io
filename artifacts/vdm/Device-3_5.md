 description | {::nomarkdown}This file defines all input/output devices that can be accessed from<br/>this CPU (definitions are not account-specific).  Each device is<br/>identified with a unique name.  Each is associated with a $I value<br/>which may correspond with a hardware port or, on layered systems,<br/>a host file or directory.  If there are several devices for the same<br/>volume set and $I, one may be given sign-on system status.  Devices<br/>may also be assigned to hunt groups to share work.  This file is<br/>cross-referenced by name, $I, volume set(CPU), and sign-on/system<br/>device.  It is also cross-referenced by hunt group, local synonym,<br/>mnemonic, subtype, and form currently mounted.{:/}

### Properties

| id | fmId | label | description | datatype | location | attributes | range | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| name | .01 | Name | {::nomarkdown}This is the name of the device. It is used at the 'DEVICE' prompt<br/>to select this device. It should not be the internal name for<br/>the device but a logical one.<br/>It must start with 1 uppercase and not contain lowercase.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| location_of_terminal | .02 | Location Of Terminal | {::nomarkdown}This is a free text description of where the device is located,<br/>e.g. Ward 2A nurse station, etc.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED |  | 
| mnemonic | .03 | Mnemonic | {::nomarkdown}These are alternate names which may be used to select the device.{:/} | [STRING] |  |  |  | 
| local_synonym | .04 | Local Synonym | {::nomarkdown}This is an alternate name which may be used to select the device.<br/>When using the LOCAL SYNONYM to select the device, selection can only<br/>occur on the local CPU.  For example, if you assigned a LOCAL SYNONYM<br/>to one device on the local CPU, and the same name to a device on<br/>the remote CPU, selection using the LOCAL SYNONYM will return<br/>the device on the local CPU.{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| purge_old_print_queue_files | .13 | Purge Old Print Queue Files | {::nomarkdown}This field determines whether old HFS files associated with entries in the<br/>PRINT QUEUE JOB (#3.52) file should be deleted. It only applies to devices<br/>of the PRINT QUEUE type. For print queues, an intermediate host file is<br/>created in the PRINT_QUEUES subdirectory. <br/><br/>Normally, these files are automatically deleted once they have been submitted<br/>to the print queue.  For those files that are not automatically deleted,<br/>there is a scheduled option that will periodically delete host files that<br/>have been somehow left in existence past their usefulness.<br/><br/>Setting this field to NO will prevent the purge option from deleting HFS files<br/>created via this device.  Setting this field to NO should only be done on<br/>a temporary basis while troubleshooting a problem involving a print queue. <br/><br/>The default value for this field is YES.  <br/><br/><br/>{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>N</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>Y</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| i | 1 | $i | {::nomarkdown}This field holds the Hardware port name that the OS can identify when<br/>referencing a port on a CPU.<br/>On layered systems where opening of host files is supported,<br/>this field may hold the host file name.<br/>When defining a spool device entry(TYPE=\SPL\) on VAX DSM or MSM-Unix,<br/>enter the name of directory where spool host files will be created.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| volume_setcpu | 1.9 | Volume Set(cpu) | {::nomarkdown}This field holds the name of the CPU to which this device belongs.<br/>This field holds the name of the CPU where the physical port resides.<br/>On DSM-11, VAX DSM, this field may hold the name of the Volume Set.<br/>On M/11+, this field may hold the name of the Directory Set.<br/> <br/>If no name has been entered for this field, this device is assumed<br/>to be accessible from all CPUs in the network.  In other words,<br/>when this device is referenced, the device handler will operate<br/>as if this device is resident on the local CPU.  <br/> <br/>For example, if there is a device that uses the same $I on each CPU,<br/>one entry can be made in the Device File by leaving the 'Volume<br/>Set(CPU)' Field null.  This shortcut will work only if the same $I<br/>has been associated with this device on every CPU.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| signon_system_device | 1.95 | Sign-on/system Device | {::nomarkdown}If answered 'YES', this field identifies that this entry is the primary<br/>device among those device entries that have the same $I with the same<br/>VOLUME SET(CPU).<br/> <br/>Among those device entries that have a common $I and CPU,<br/>only one of these entries can have this field set to 'YES'.<br/>If none of the common device entries are set to 'YES', the<br/>default device will be identified by the first device on<br/>the CPU x-ref.  The default device is used when the device<br/>handler is invoked with $I as the device to be selected.{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| type-2 | 2 | Type | {::nomarkdown}This field has the general type of device on the CPU.  'TRM' is the most<br/>common entry.<br/>      TRM -- Terminal devices such as most crts and printers<br/>             should be associated with a corresponding device entry<br/>             with a type of 'TRM'.<br/>      HFS -- Host File Server is only available on mumps platforms<br/>             that exists on a layered system(e.g.: VMS, UNIX, NT, etc.).<br/>             This type and the associated functionality provides<br/>             the vehicle to read and write to host level files.<br/>             Instead of directing reports to a printer, the results<br/>             could be placed into a VMS, NT or UNIX file.  This would<br/>             allow a non-mumps based statistical package or spreadsheet<br/>             to use data produced by the mumps based application by<br/>             simply extracting data from the host file.<br/>     VTRM -- Virtual Terminal Server devices are those that are associated<br/>             with a dynamically created mumps port identification($I).<br/>             A generic device entry with a device type of 'VTRM'<br/>             can be established for users who log into the system<br/>             through terminal servers.<br/>      RES -- Resources is a type used for special sequencing of tasks<br/>             that do not require a particular device.<br/>     CHAN -- Network Channels are high speed devices that use network<br/>             protocols such as TCP/IP.<br/>      OTH -- Other devices that do not fit a particular category<br/>             should be given a type of 'OTH'.<br/>       MT -- Magtape device should have a type of 'MT'.<br/>      SPL -- Spool device is a predefined allocated disk space similar<br/>             to SDP.  However, access to the spool device can be achieved<br/>             from multiple users simultaneously.<br/>      BAR -- Bar code reader.  This type identifies the device<br/>             as a barcode reader.<br/>      SDP -- Sequential Disk Processor is a predefined allocated<br/>             disk space used for sequential processing.  On DSM-11<br/>             and M/11+ systems, devices 59 thru 62 are reserved for SDP.<br/>             On MSM, the Sequential Block Processor(SBP) is essentially<br/>             the same as SDP. This has been replaced with HFS.<br/>     IMPC -- Imaging work station device(reserved for future use for<br/>             DHCP Imaging Project).<br/>     PQ   -- Print Queues.  This type of device will be used on<br/>             Cache/VMS,Linux, or Unix systems to create host files and<br/>             pass them to a print server.  Print Queue devices are<br/>             not used on Windows systems.<br/><br/>{:/} | ENUMERATION |  | REQUIRED | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>SPL</dt><dd>SPOOL</dd><dt>BAR</dt><dd>BARCODE READER</dd><dt>SDP</dt><dd>SDP</dd><dt>VTRM</dt><dd>VIRTUAL TERMINAL</dd><dt>CHAN</dt><dd>NETWORK CHANNEL</dd><dt>PQ</dt><dd>PRINT QUEUE</dd><dt>TRM</dt><dd>TERMINAL</dd><dt>MT</dt><dd>MAGTAPE</dd><dt>OTH</dt><dd>OTHER</dd><dt>IMPC</dt><dd>IMAGING WORK STATION</dd><dt>HFS</dt><dd>HOST FILE SERVER</dd><dt>RES</dt><dd>RESOURCES</dd></dl>{:/} |

| queuing | 5.5 | Queuing | {::nomarkdown}When this field is set to FORCED and queuing is allowed by the calling<br/>program (%ZIS[\Q\), the Device Handler will return IO(\Q\)=1 upon<br/>device selection and the job will be queued.  That is, the user<br/>does not need to enter \Q\ to invoke queuing and will not be prompted<br/>with the question about wanting output queued.
