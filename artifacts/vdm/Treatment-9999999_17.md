<dt>description</dt><dd>This file is a table with site defined Treatment names.  These are names<br/>of treatments that are not covered in the ICD-CM Procedures or the CPT<br/>Procedures.  Examples may include treatments such as Ear Irrigation, or <br/>Instructions or Counseling given to a patient for a Medical Problem.<br/> <br/>When the treatment names are associated with a patients visit, they are<br/>for clinical use and do not contribute to billing and workload because of<br/>the lack of a coded CPT or ICD-CM.</dd>
