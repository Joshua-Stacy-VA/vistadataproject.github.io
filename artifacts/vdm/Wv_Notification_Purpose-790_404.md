| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| notification_purpose | .01 | Notification Purpose | {::nomarkdown}This field stores the reason for the notification.  The reason should<br/>include information that distinguishes it (the letter/notification) from<br/>similar procedure/test results or future treatment needs. For example,<br/>pregnancy test positive vs. pregnancy test negative; PAP (Annual Due)<br/>vs.PAP (Follow-up Due).{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| priority | .02 | Priority | {::nomarkdown}This field associates a priority with the notification.  The priority<br/>choices are (1) urgent, (2) ASAP, and (3) routine. These priorities are<br/>used within the Browse Notifications options to print a list of<br/>notifications by priority.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  | REQUIRED | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>1</dt><dd>URGENT</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>ROUTINE</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>ASAP</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| synonym | .03 | Synonym | {::nomarkdown}This field contains an abbreviation or short synonym that is used to<br/>select a type of notification.  For example, \P6\ for \PAP 6 weeks<br/>post PAP\ or \C1\ for \Colp follow-up, PAP next month.\{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| active | .04 | Active | {::nomarkdown}This field contains a set of codes (1 = Yes, 0 = No) used to display or<br/>hide an entry in a selection list.  If the field is active and contains a<br/>'1' or yes, users of this package can select the entry. {:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| associate_with_br_cx_tx | .05 | Associate With Br/cx Tx | {::nomarkdown}This field has a 2-fold purpose. It identifies that the notification<br/>letter is associated with cervical or breast treatment needs and also<br/>determines a default print date based on the treatment need type. The<br/>value of this field is a set of codes (BR for breast Tx need; CX for<br/>cervical Tx need).  If a clinician does not want to automatically print a<br/>letter, the field may be left blank.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>BR</dt><dd>BREAST TX</dd><dt>CX</dt><dd>CERVICAL TX</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| result_or_reminder_letter | .06 | Result Or Reminder Letter | {::nomarkdown}This field contains a code (1 = Result; 2 = Reminder) used to determine a<br/>print date for the letter.  A notification identified as a result is<br/>printed immediately and a reminder is printed on a future date (e.g.,<br/>Annual PAP).{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>REMINDER</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>RESULT</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| br_tx_need | .07 | Br Tx Need | {::nomarkdown}Use this field to assign a breast treament need from the WV BREAST TX <br/>NEED file (#790.51) to this particular purpose of notification.<br/> <br/>When a Clinical Reminder uses this purpose of notification to result a <br/>patient's breast procedure, the breast treatment need linked to this <br/>purpose of notification will be automatically assigned to the patient in<br/>the WV PATIENT file (#790).{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Wv_Breast_Tx_Need-790_51 | 
| br_tx_due_date | .08 | Br Tx Due Date | {::nomarkdown}This field is the amount of time to add to the procedure date or current<br/>date to calculate a new breast treatment due date. The value should be a<br/>number followed by \D\, \M\ or \Y\ (without the quotes). D indicates days.<br/>M indicates months. Y indicates years.<br/> <br/>For example, \90D\ means add 90 days to the procedure date or current date<br/>to calculate the new breast treatment due date. This new treatment date<br/>will be automatically assigned to the patient in the WV PATIENT file<br/>(#790).{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

| cx_tx_due_date | .1 | Cx Tx Due Date | {::nomarkdown}This field is the amount of time to add to the procedure date or current<br/>date to calculate a new cervical treatment due date.
