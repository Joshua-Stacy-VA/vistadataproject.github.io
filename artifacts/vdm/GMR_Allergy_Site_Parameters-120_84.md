### Properties

| id | fmId | label | description | datatype | location | attributes | range | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| name | .01 | Name | {::nomarkdown}This field is the name of this set of parameters.  The name of the base<br/>set that is sent out is \HOSPITAL\.  The code will work more efficiently<br/>if the name of the base set of parameters is not changed from \HOSPITAL\.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| top_10_reactions | 1 | Top 10 Reactions | {::nomarkdown}A list of reactions for the user to choose from when selecting reactions<br/>for a patient allergy/adverse reactions.  These will be the ten most<br/>common reactions, and modifiable by the site.{:/} | [POINTER] |  |  | {id:Sign_symptoms-120_83} | 
| autoverify_food_drug_other | 2 | Autoverify Food/drug/other | {::nomarkdown}This field determines which types of allergies a site wants autoverified<br/>at the user sign off.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>2</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY FOOD ONLY</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY FOOD/OTHER</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY ALL</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY DRUG/OTHER</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>NO AUTOVERIFY</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY DRUG/FOOD</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY DRUG ONLY</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY OTHER ONLY</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| autoverify_observed_historical | 3 | Autoverify Observed/historical | {::nomarkdown}This field is configurable by the site to allow autoverification of<br/>observed or historical allergies.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>NO AUTOVERIFY</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY OBSERVED ONLY</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>AUTOVERIFY BOTH</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| autoverify_logical_operator | 3.5 | Autoverify Logical Operator | {::nomarkdown}This field will determine how the Autoverify Food/Drug/Other and<br/>Autoverify Observed/Historical parameters relate to each other.  OR means<br/>that the reaction will be autoverified if it meets the criteria of one of<br/>the two parameters, while AND means the reaction will be autoverified only<br/>if it meets the criteria of both parameters.  If this field is left null,<br/>the OR condition will be used.<br/> <br/>For example, if you want to verify only observed drug reactions, you would<br/>set the Autoverify Food/Drug/Other parameter to AUTOVERIFY FOOD/OTHER<br/>and the Autoverify Observed/Historical to AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY<br/>, and the<br/>Autoverify Logical Operator to OR.  This means that a reaction that has<br/>a type of Food/Other OR is Historical will be autoverified, thus leaving<br/>observed drug reactions to be verified.<br/> <br/>Another example would be if you wanted to verify all observed reactions<br/>and all drug reactions whether observed or historical.  The parameters<br/>should be set accordingly:  Autoverify Food/Drug/Other to AUTOVERIFY<br/>FOOD/OTHER, Autoverify Observed/Historical to AUTOVERIFY HISTORICAL ONLY<br/> and<br/>Autoverify Logical Operator to AND.  In this case to be autoverifed, a<br/>reaction has to have a type of Food/Other AND it must be Historical, all<br/>other reactions will need to be verified.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>&</dt><dd>AND</dd><dt>!</dt><dd>OR</dd></dl>{:/} |

| mark_id_band_flag | 7 | Mark Id Band Flag | {::nomarkdown}This field is an indicator to denote whether the site wants<br/>to document if the patient ID band should be marked for<br/>a certain allergy.<br/>The system will assume the site wants to document the marking of inpatient<br/>ID bands.  If this field is answered NO, the site does not want to<br/>document the marking of inpatient ID bands.{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>1</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| method_of_notification | 7.1 | Method Of Notification | {::nomarkdown}This field tells ART if or how the users should be notified for chart<br/>or ID band markings.  There are three methods. The first method is the<br/>use of BULLETINs,  which is the current way ART works.  The<br/>second method is the use of OE/RR Teams.  If this method is used, then<br/>you will need to set up different teams for each ward and also assign<br/>printers to these teams.  The third method is to turn off the function.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>BULLETIN</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>OE/RR TEAMS</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>NO NOTIFICATION</dd></dl>{:/} |
