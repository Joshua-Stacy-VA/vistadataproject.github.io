| type-4 | 4 | Type | {::nomarkdown}This field defines the type of protocol to be executed.  Types Q, O, and<br/>L are strictly related to the 'Add orders' function.<br/>  Q = Protocol menu - used for displaying and selecting orderable items<br/>during the add sequence. When this type of protocol is encountered<br/>OE/RR will ask the 'Select PATIENT:,' 'LOCATION:,' 'Provider:'<br/>prompts and execute the transaction logic for the new orders<br/>screen.  This is also true for type O and L.<br/>O = Protocol - same as Q but the protocol is the item selected.<br/>Protocols are directly executed when encountered.<br/>L = Limited protocol - same as O but any existing sub-items are<br/>not executed.<br/>M = Menu - used for displaying and selecting items.<br/>X = Extended action - protocols of this type execute the entry action<br/>plus all sub-items.<br/>  A = Action - same as X but any existing sub-items are<br/>not executed.<br/>  X = Extended action - protocols of this type execute the entry action<br/>      plus all sub-items.<br/> <br/>  A = Action - same as X but any existing sub-items are<br/>      not executed.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  | REQUIRED | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>T</dt><dd>term</dd><dt>O</dt><dd>protocol</dd><dt>M</dt><dd>menu</dd><dt>Q</dt><dd>protocol menu</dd><dt>E</dt><dd>event driver</dd><dt>S</dt><dd>subscriber</dd><dt>X</dt><dd>extended action</dd><dt>D</dt><dd>dialog</dd><dt>A</dt><dd>action</dd><dt>L</dt><dd>limited protocol</dd></dl>{:/} |

| required_variables | 21 | Required Variables | {::nomarkdown}This lists the variables that must be defined for the proper execution of<br/>this protocol.  This aids in documenting the protocol.  Also, in the case<br/>of ';' jumping, the variables defined as required may be newed before<br/>jumping, thus preserving the context when returning from the jump.{:/} | [STRING] |  |  |  | 
| screen | 24 | Screen | {::nomarkdown}This field contains MUMPS code that screens out menu items or the<br/>execution of particular items in a protocol.  Before each item is<br/>displayed or executed, the screen is executed and the item is only<br/>processed if $T is true.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

| path_switch | 43 | Path Switch | {::nomarkdown}This allows the user, when traversing back UP the tree of protocols, to<br/>select a new path back down the tree.  In other words, the menu is<br/>redisplayed when returning to that menu's level in the tree, and processing<br/>back down the tree is possible from that point.  If nothing is selected<br/>from the menu, the path continues back up the tree.{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>N</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>Y</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} |

| requires_signature | 101.01 | Requires Signature | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to specify an orderable/protocol that does not<br/>require a physician signature in OE/RR.  Some of the things entered<br/>in OE/RR are considered instructions and don't require physician<br/>signature.  An example of this might be an entry for an Early/Late tray.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>1</dt><dd>NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED</dd><dt>0</dt><dd>PHYSICIAN SIGNATURE</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| domain_data_type | 101.041 | Domain (data Type) | {::nomarkdown}This is the data type of a term (i.e. protocol of type term) used in a<br/>dialog.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>F</dt><dd>free text</dd><dt>S</dt><dd>set of codes</dd><dt>L</dt><dd>list or range</dd><dt>M</dt><dd>menu</dd><dt>N</dt><dd>numeric</dd><dt>Y</dt><dd>yes/no</dd><dt>D</dt><dd>date/time</dd><dt>W</dt><dd>word processing</dd><dt>P</dt><dd>pointer</dd></dl>{:/} |

| domain_parameter | 101.045 | Domain Parameter | {::nomarkdown}This is a parameter that may be used to further specify the data type<br/>(i.e. input transform) for a term protocol.  The parameter is what would<br/>be placed in the second up-arrow piece of DIR(0) when calling the reader.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| method | 101.05 | Method | {::nomarkdown}This number identifies individual methods (actions) that may be invoked<br/>for this protocol.{:/} | [OBJECT] |  |  | [Method-101_05](#Method-101_05)  | 
| set_membership | 101.07 | Set Membership | {::nomarkdown}This is a namespaced name of a set.  If this is entered, a cross reference<br/>of the format \S.set membership\ is created.  This allows rapid lookups on<br/>subsets of the Protocol file.{:/} | [STRING] |  |  |  | 
| sending_application | 770.1 | Sending Application | {::nomarkdown}Enter the name of the application that initiates a transaction. It<br/>is required only when defining an EVENT POINT protocol.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Application_Parameter-771 | 
| response_message_type | 770.11 | Response Message Type | {::nomarkdown}Enter the message type of the expected RESPONSE. It should only be defined<br/>on a SUBSCRIBER PROTOCOL.<br/> <br/>NOTE:<br/>In a contract between the initiating system and the responding system, the<br/>Event Driver protocol defines the characteristics of the INITIATING<br/>SYSTEM. The Initiating System initiates either queries or unsolicited<br/>update messages. A Subscriber Protocol defines the characteristics of the<br/>RESPONDING SYSTEM. The responding system completes a transaction by<br/>returning either an acknowledgement and/or a response to the specific<br/>query message.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Message_Type-771_2 | 
| batch_file_message_commit_ack | 770.14 | Batch/file Message Commit Ack | {::nomarkdown}In a bi-directional interface, this field will be used <br/>to determine whether or not a Batch or File message should<br/>send or receive a Commit Acknowledgement.  A Batch or File<br/>message will always send/receive an Application Ack. This<br/>feature is non-standard according to HL7.  It is needed to<br/>insure the receipt of a message.{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| receiving_application | 770.2 | Receiving Application | {::nomarkdown}This is the application that receives a message. It is otherwise known as<br/>the <br/>esponding\ application when a transaction takes place. This<br/>information is required for SUBSCRIBER protocols only.{:/} | POINTER |  | INDEXED | Hl7_Application_Parameter-771 | 
| transaction_message_type | 770.3 | Transaction Message Type | {::nomarkdown}Enter the name of the message type for the the message that is sent from<br/>the initiating system. When initiating a new transaction, this field is<br/>referenced when generating the header for the outbound message.<br/> <br/>NOTE:<br/>In a contract between the initiating system and the responding system, the<br/>Event Driver protocol defines the characteristics of the INITIATING<br/>SYSTEM. The Initiating System initiates either queries or unsolicited<br/>update messages. A Subscriber Protocol defines the characteristics of the<br/>RESPONDING SYSTEM. The responding system completes a transaction by<br/>returning either an acknowledgement and/or a response to the specific<br/>query message.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Message_Type-771_2 | 
| event_type | 770.4 | Event Type | {::nomarkdown}This is the HL7 Event Type code for the message represented by this<br/>protocol. In HL7, the message type and event type of an application<br/>response message may be different from the original message.<br/> <br/>If this is an event point protocol, enter the event type<br/>corresponding to the initial message generated by the SENDING APPLICATION.<br/> <br/> <br/>If this is a subscriber protocol, then enter the event type corresponding<br/>to the RECEIVING APPLICATION response. Note that an event type is not<br/>required when responding with a general acknowledgement (ACK) and the<br/>receiving application does not always need to generate a response.<br/> <br/>NOTE:<br/> <br/>1. In \original acknowledgement mode\ the receiving application always<br/>generates the response.<br/>2. In \enhanced acknowledgement mode\ the HL7 package may be configured to<br/>produce a \commit ack\ before the application receives the message. If the<br/>receiving application does not need to generate a response in addition to<br/>the ack, then the event type is the same as the original message (and the<br/>message type would be ACK)<br/>3. In \enhanced acknowledgement mode with two-phase commit\ the HL7<br/>package generates a commit ack, and passes the message to the application.<br/>The second phase of the transaction occurs when the application is ready<br/>to initiate a response. This is interpreted as the start of a new<br/>transaction and may require a commit ack itself.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Event_Type_Code-779_001 | 
| message_structure | 770.5 | Message Structure | {::nomarkdown}The message structure is associated with the message type and event type defined by HL7 v2.3.1 and beyond.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Message_Structure_Code-779_005 | 
| processing_id | 770.6 | Processing Id | {::nomarkdown}This field describes how a message should be processed once it is handed<br/>off to the receiving application. <br/> <br/>PROCESSING ID is a required field in the HL7 message header. However, the<br/>Event Driver protocol entry is only used whenset to DEBUG. Data for the<br/>header is normally derived from the HL COMMUNICATION SERVER FILE. If<br/>testing a transaction in Debug mode, make sure it is changed on both the<br/>sending and receiving system.<br/> <br/> <br/>The receiving application developer should consider checking this portion<br/>of the header before filing data on a production system. Training and<br/>Debug messages may not be suitable for filing.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>D</dt><dd>debug</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| logical_link | 770.7 | Logical Link | {::nomarkdown}This field is used with a SUBSCRIBER PROTOCOL to describe the network path<br/>to the subscriber. It is most often used with a fixed point-to-point<br/>interface between Vista and another system, e.g., a local COTS application<br/>or another Vista facility. See the documentation on use of the ROUTING<br/>LOGIC field and \dynamic addressing\ for more complex routing scenarios.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl_Logical_Link-870 | 
| accept_ack_code | 770.8 | Accept Ack Code | {::nomarkdown}This field defines whether or not a COMMIT ACK will be generated by the<br/>HL7 package. This only applies to transactions using version 2.2 and<br/>higher of the HL7 Standard. See Chapter 2 of the HL7 Standard for details<br/>of Enhanced Mode Acknowledgements.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Accept_application_Ack_Condition-779_003 | 
| application_ack_type | 770.9 | Application Ack Type | {::nomarkdown}For transactions using versions 2.2 and higher of the HL7 standard, this<br/>field defines whether or not the receiving application is expected to<br/>return an acknowledgement. Enhanced Mode Application Acks are always<br/>initiated as a new transaction. The following is an example of a 2-phased<br/>acknowledgement over a tcp connection.<br/> <br/> <br/>(A)INITIATING SYSTEM         (B)RESPONDING SYSTEM<br/> <br/>PHASE I<br/>Open connection to B<br/>send ADT/A04----------------->receive ADT/A04<br/>                              validate header<br/>                              commit to safe storage<br/>receive CA<-------------------send CA to A<br/>Close connection<br/> <br/>PHASE II<br/>                              handoff to receiving Application<br/>                              parse and validate message content<br/>                              generate APPLICATION ACCEPT ACK<br/>                              Open connection to A<br/>receive AA<-------------------send AA<br/>validate header<br/>commit to safe storage<br/>send CA to B------------------>receive CA<br/>                               close connection{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Accept_application_Ack_Condition-779_003 | 
| version_id | 770.95 | Version Id | {::nomarkdown}Enter the version of the HL7 standard used to implement this transaction.<br/> <br/>Note that a screen has been added to insure that the version selected<br/>corresponds to the appropriate version of the Message Type defined.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Hl7_Version-771_5 | 
| processing_routine | 771 | Processing Routine | {::nomarkdown}This field is executed on the receiving system. It defines the routine<br/>used to process the original inbound message in a transaction and to<br/>GENERATE and APPLICATION response/ACK back to the sending system using the<br/>entry point, GENACK^HLMA1.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| response_processing_routine | 772 | Response Processing Routine | {::nomarkdown}This field is executed on the sending system when an Acknowledgement or<br/>Query response is received. The message ID of the original message is<br/>always contained within the response. This is used to identify the<br/>location of the original message and the corresponding event point<br/>protocol. Note that this pertains to Original and Enhanced Mode<br/>Application Acks only. The HL7 package generates and processes<br/>Enhanced mode Commit Accepts internally.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

| ack_mode_set_in_subscriber | 773.5 | Ack Mode Set In Subscriber | {::nomarkdown}A 'YES' of this field will indicate that MSH-15 and MSH-16 will be taken<br/>from Subscriber protocol instead of the value(s) defined in Event driver <br/>protocol.{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| routing_logic | 774 | Routing Logic | {::nomarkdown}M code in this field is executed only when a message is in an OUTBOUND<br/>state. Normally, Vista HL7 'broadcasts' a message to all subscribers<br/>whenever a message is generated. However, in some cases, a client may need<br/>to receive the message only if it matches a particular condition. This<br/>field allows you to set up screening logic to interpret the message and<br/>dynamically address the message to those interested in the data when it<br/>meets these conditions. The output of your routing logic routine should be<br/>the creation of a list of additional message recipients set into the<br/>HLL(\LINKS\) array.<br/> <br/>For details on dynamic addressing, see the documentation for HL*1.6*14.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |
