<dt>description</dt><dd> <br/>This file contains entries which represent the functional subdivisions<br/>or departments of the laboratory, referred to by the Laboratory package<br/>software as accession areas.  The file is used to define the site-specific<br/>information needed by your laboratory for each accession area.  This <br/>includes the type of accession transform (or how often the accession <br/>numbers assigned to test performed in that area will be reset to 1), the<br/>abbreviation of the area (which becomes part of the accession identifying<br/>the specimen and test results), the order in which the data for tests<br/>performed in the area will be displayed and other specific information.<br/> <br/>Definitions of variables used:<br/> LRDFN = Internal entry in LR( that is being worked on.<br/> LRIDT = Inverse date/time that data is stored at. ^LR(LRDFN,\CH\,<br/> LRAA = internal value of accession area ^LRO(68,<br/> LRAD = date working on in accession area ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,<br/> LRAN = accession number working on ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,<br/> LRODT = order date ^LRO(69,<br/> LRSN = order entry within date ^LRO(69,LRORD,1,<br/>CROSS REFERENCE DESCRIPTION:<br/> ^LRO(68,\B\,'ACCESSION AREA',LRAA)<br/> ^LRO(68,\AC\,LRDFN,'DATE RESULTS AVAILABLE','DATA NODE') =<br/>    used by the cumulative<br/> ^LRO(68,\AD\,'LAB SECTION',LRAC)<br/> ^LRO(68,\AVS\,LRAA,LRAD,LRAN)=LRDFN^LRIDT<br/>    used by micro verify by supervisor<br/> ^LRO(68,\MI\,LRDFN,LRIDT)<br/>    used by micro for cumulative report<br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,LRAN,\AE\)<br/>    used for WKLD count<br/>  <br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,\B\,'ENTRY FILE 69',LRAN)<br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,\C\,'IDENTITY',LRAN)<br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,\E\,'LAB ARRIVAL TIME',LRAN)<br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,\D\,'ORDER #',LRAN)<br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,\AC\,'DATE/TIME COMPLETE',LRAN)<br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,1,\AD\,'DATE COMPLETE',LRAN)<br/> ^LRO(68,LRAA,1,LRAD,4,\B\,'LAB TEST',LRAN)</dd>

| type_of_accession_number | .092 | Type Of Accession Number | {::nomarkdown}This field determines whether a full unique accession number is used for<br/>barcoding and messages between instruments.  The unique accession number<br/>is built from three different numbers, the accession area, the date, and<br/>the accession entry number. If 'S'hort is selected, the accession number<br/>used in barcodes and for input at the instrument keypad is treated the <br/>same as it was traditionally.  The 'L'ong unique accession will always be<br/>generated, it just won't be used in communicating with the instrument, or <br/>for barcoding.  <br/>Examples of the four accession transform<br/>types are:<br/><br/> Daily/Weekly:   3242889999<br/> where     32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)<br/>            4 is the last digit of the year (1994)<br/>          288 is the Julian date for Oct 15, 1994<br/>         9999 is the 9,999th accession for that date<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3242889999, 'S'hort would be 9999<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3242880001, 'S'hort would be 1<br/><br/> Yearly:   3294999999<br/> where      32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)<br/>            94 is the last two digits of the year (1994)<br/>        999999 is the 999,999th accession for that year<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3294999999, 'S'hort would be 999999<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3294000001, 'S'hort would be 1<br/><br/> Quarterly:   3240499999<br/> where      32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)<br/>             4 is the last digit of the year (1994)<br/>            04 is the fourth quarter of 1994<br/>         99999 is the 99,999th accession for that quarter<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3240499999, 'S'hort would be 99999<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3240400001, 'S'hort would be 1<br/><br/> Monthly:   3241299999<br/> where      32 is the Accession area identifier (field .091)<br/>             4 is the last digit of the year (1994)<br/>            12 is the twelfth month of 1994<br/>         99999 is the 99,999th accession for that month<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3241299999, 'S'hort would be 99999<br/> If the 'L'ong version was 3241200001, 'S'hort would be 1{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>S</dt><dd>SHORT</dd><dt>L</dt><dd>LONG</dd></dl>{:/} |

| non_lab_accession_area | .097 | Non Lab Accession Area | {::nomarkdown} This field indicates if this particular accession area is operated by<br/>another service other than Pathology & Laboratory Medicine. If this<br/>accession area in staffed or funded from non Pathology sources, mark this<br/>field yes.<br/>   An example would be Blood Gas laboratory staffed or funded by<br/>Medicine service.<br/> <br/>HOWEVER<br/>If this accession area is used by Point of Care (ie. Nurses entering<br/>finger stick glucose) do not set this field to yes. Because in this case<br/>the location is relevant to DSS database.<br/> <br/>This field is used by the Laboratory DSS workload extraction routine to<br/>determine if the patient location should be passed or not.{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} |

| numeric_identifier | .4 | Numeric Identifier | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to build the unique accession identifier number.<br/>It is used as the first two characters of the number.  Use the numbers 1-9<br/>and uppercase letters A-Z to designate the identifier. For example, if<br/>you enter 99 all accession identifiers for this accession area will<br/>start with 99, e.g. 9923400025.<br/> <br/>If a single character is used the system will append a leading zero to<br/>the unique identifier generated.<br/> <br/>No two accession areas can use the same identifier.<br/> <br/>Changing the identifier should only be performed when accessioning is not<br/>occurring and when a situation requires it since personnel will memorize<br/>this identifier as representing the accesson area.<br/> <br/>Do NOT switch identifiers between active accession areas since this could<br/>compromise the uniqueness of the resulting unique identifier (UID). The<br/>software when generating a UID checks for the existence of the UID it will<br/>create for an accession. If it currently exists the UID being created will<br/>have \00\ as the numeric identifier.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

This API is used<br/>to capture CPT codes for laboratory procedures.<br/> <br/>Special OOS Hospital locations have been created that are solely used for<br/>recording workload (No count locations). These OOS location all begin with<br/>'LAB DIV' in their names.<br/> <br/>Example of name:<br/>LAB DIV 600 OOS ID 108<br/>Where 600 is the Station Number from the Institution file (#4).<br/>Where 600 is the division Station Number where the work is done.<br/>Where 108 is the OOS ID (stop code) for the service doing the work.<br/> <br/>Note: The stop code could be one assigned to another service, ie Medicine.<br/>Stop Codes are not limited to Laboratory 108.<br/> <br/>The Laboratory Information Manager has special options used to create new<br/>OOS locations in HOSPITAL LOCATION file. These options are used when and<br/>new division is established or a new stop code is required.<br/> <br/>The location names are constructed by the option and should not be altered<br/>using FileMan. The naming convention is critical to the ability to assign<br/>OOS Hospital Locations to Laboratory Accession (#68) file.<br/> <br/>If a given Accession Area in the Accession file (#68) does not have a<br/>LAB OOS LOCATION S LOCATION (#.8) Hospital Location assigned, the DEFAULT<br/>LAB OOS LOCATION (#.8) from the LABORATORY SITE (#69.9) file will be used.<br/>If the DEFAULT LAB OOS LOCATION field is not defined, no workload will be<br/>captured.{:/} | POINTER |  |  | [Hospital_Location-44](Hospital_Location-44.md) |
