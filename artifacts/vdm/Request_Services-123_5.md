This grouping capability<br/>may be used with Review screens to filter out consults to a <br/>service, sub-service, specialty, or sub-specialty of consults/requests.<br/>  <br/>The main entry in this file is the \ALL SERVICES\ entry.  Other entries<br/>should be subordinate in its hierarchy.<br/> <br/>The \ALL SERVICES\ entry is used to display the hierarchy of the hospital<br/>services when the Clinician ordering a consult is prompted for<br/>\Select TO Service/Specialty:\ to send the consult to.{:/}</dd>
