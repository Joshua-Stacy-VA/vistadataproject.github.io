 description | {::nomarkdown}This file stores TIU Templates, which are on-the-fly boilerplates that<br/>can be added to any note or addendum in the CPRS GUI.  All shared and<br/>personal templates, as well as template hierarchy, are stored within<br/>this file.<br/> <br/>Duplicate template names are allowed, usually distinguished by personal<br/>owner.<br/> <br/>This file is intended for the CPRS GUI only.  No server side<br/>implementation is provided or feasible.  Maintenance of this file<br/>should only be performed using the Template Editor, which is contained<br/>within the CPRS GUI.  Bypassing the template editor can cause file<br/>structure problems.{:/}

| name | .01 | Name | {::nomarkdown}This is the name of the template as it will appear in the template tree,<br/>3-60 characters in length, not starting with punctuation.<br/> <br/>Duplicate NAMEs ARE permitted, and are distinguished by the tree they<br/>belong to.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| blank_lines | .02 | Blank Lines | {::nomarkdown}This is the number of blank lines inserted between Group Template items<br/>when the template is used for composing documents.<br/> <br/>For example, suppose a Group Template DEMOGRAPHICS has item templates NAME<br/>and ADDRESS, each with boilerplate as shown:<br/> <br/>       Template        Boilerplate<br/>       -------------------------------<br/>       NAME            Patient Name:<br/>       ADDRESS         Street Address:<br/>                       City:<br/>                       State, Zip:<br/> <br/>Then the boilerplate for a document entered using template DEMOGRAPHICS<br/>with BLANK LINES = 1 would look like:<br/> <br/>  Patient Name:<br/>                    << 1 blank line<br/>  Street Address:<br/>  City:<br/>  State, Zip:<br/> <br/>BLANK LINES can have values from 0 to 3.  BLANK LINES applies only to<br/>GROUP TEMPLATES.  The default value for BLANK LINES is 0.{:/} | NUMERIC |  |  |  | 
| type-_03 | .03 | Type | {::nomarkdown}The TIU TEMPLATE FILE stores templates for use in composing documents and<br/>also stores the containers which organize the templates into trees. Every<br/>entry in the file belongs to at least one tree.  Some entries contain<br/>other entries as items.<br/> <br/>There are 5 types of entries in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE:<br/>      'T' for TEMPLATE<br/>      'G' for GROUP TEMPLATE<br/>      'C' for CONTAINER<br/>      'P' for PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER<br/>      'R' for SHARED ROOT CONTAINER<br/>      'TF' for TITLE ROOT FOLDER<br/>      'CF' for CONSULT ROOT FOLDER<br/>      'OF' for PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER <br/><br/>The first two types, T and G, are true templates and may be selected<br/>for composing documents.<br/> <br/>The remaining types are \containers\ which hold templates as items.<br/>The purpose of the container types is to organize templates according<br/>to subject matter into trees, so that individual templates can be easily<br/>found as \leaves\ of a tree.  Container types are NOT used for<br/>composing documents.<br/> <br/>Besides holding templates, containers may hold other containers, which<br/>then function as subcontainers.<br/> <br/>The last five types, P, R, TF, CF, and OF, are containers of a special<br/>type, denoted <br/>oots\.  A root functions as the single top level of its<br/>tree.  Each site has a \shared\ root container, which contains templates<br/>shared across the whole facility.  Each user at a site has a \personal\<br/>root container, which contains the user's personal templates.  Thus, each<br/>user at a site has access to two trees: the shared tree, and their own<br/>personal tree.  The Title, Consult and Procedure root folders are special <br/>folders that allow templates to be linked to specific TIU Titles, Consult<br/>Reasons for Request, and Procedure Reasons for Request.<br/> <br/>Root containers (like all container types) hold templates of type T and G,<br/>and may also hold subcontainers (type C).<br/> <br/>                             TYPE DETAILS <br/> 'T': A TEMPLATE is the most basic piece of boilerplate text desired.  It<br/>may be used by itself for composing documents, or it may be added as an<br/>item to a Group Template, becoming part of a larger template.<br/> <br/> 'G': A GROUP TEMPLATE  is a composite of its item TEMPLATES.  In addition<br/>to the boilerplate text of its items, it may also have its own boilerplate<br/>text. A GROUP TEMPLATE may also have items of type CONTAINER (C).  These<br/>items are for storage only; they are ignored when the GROUP TEMPLATE is<br/>used to compose a document.<br/> <br/> 'C': A CLASS CONTAINER is a container for templates. In addition to<br/>templates, it may also contain other containers (C), which then function<br/>as subcontainers.<br/> <br/> 'P': A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER functions as the root (top level) of a<br/>user's personal template tree. A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER may contain both<br/>shared and personal entries.<br/> <br/>When adding shared entries to their personal trees, users need to be aware<br/>that changes made at the facility level to a shared template will carry<br/>over to their personal tree. Changes a user makes to a shared entry in<br/>their personal tree do NOT, however, carry over to the shared tree.<br/>Instead, when a user goes to edit a shared item under his/her PERSONAL<br/>ROOT CONTAINER, that item is copied, and the user made the PERSONAL OWNER<br/>of the copy. The original shared item remains the same in the shared tree.<br/> <br/> 'R': A SHARED ROOT CONTAINER is shared across a site.  Templates<br/>contained in it may be selected by any user composing a document, but the<br/>user may not edit the template itself. Besides its use for documents, a<br/>site's shared tree functions as a repository from which users can add<br/>templates to their own personal tree.<br/> <br/> 'TF': The TITLE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific TIU Titles.  <br/>Although end users will not see this folder directly, they will see<br/>templates appear automatically when the associated TIU Title is selected.<br/> <br/> 'CF': The CONSULT ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Consult Reasons<br/>for Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, but they will<br/>see templates appear automatically when ordering a consult, and the<br/>associated Consult service is selected.<br/> <br/> 'OF': The PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Procedure <br/>Reasons for Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, but<br/>they will see templates appear automatically when ordering a procedure,<br/>and the associated procedure is selected.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  | REQUIRED | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>OF</dt><dd>PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER</dd><dt>CF</dt><dd>CONSULT ROOT FOLDER</dd><dt>R</dt><dd>SHARED ROOT CONTAINER</dd><dt>C</dt><dd>CLASS CONTAINER</dd><dt>TF</dt><dd>TITLE ROOT FOLDER</dd><dt>P</dt><dd>PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER</dd><dt>T</dt><dd>TEMPLATE</dd><dt>G</dt><dd>GROUP TEMPLATE</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| status | .04 | Status | {::nomarkdown}Entries in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE have status ACTIVE or INACTIVE. Status<br/>INACTIVE serves as a way to hide entries from users composing documents.<br/> <br/>INACTIVE templates are NOT available for composing documents. In theory,<br/>ACTIVE templates ARE available.  In fact, however, even an ACTIVE<br/>template's select ability depends on its position in the tree, as will be<br/>seen below.<br/> <br/>Containers, for their part, may also have status ACTIVE or INACTIVE, and<br/>may contain ACTIVE or INACTIVE items.  Thus, an INACTIVE container may<br/>contain ACTIVE templates.  However, an INACTIVE container and all its<br/>items (whatever status) are hidden from the user composing documents and<br/>are thus not selectable.<br/> <br/>Although users are permitted to have more than one Personal Root<br/>Container, only one per user is allowed to be ACTIVE at a given time.<br/>Similarly, a site can have only one ACTIVE Shared Root Container at a<br/>given time.<br/> <br/>If an entry is no longer desired for either storage or for composing<br/>documents, it can be deleted.  However, once the last occurrence of it as<br/>an item in any tree is deleted, it is deleted from the file itself and<br/>cannot be retrieved.  Therefore, users are encouraged to INACTIVATE<br/>entries rather than delete them unless they are sure they won't want them<br/>back in the future.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>A</dt><dd>ACTIVE</dd><dt>I</dt><dd>INACTIVE</dd></dl>{:/} |
