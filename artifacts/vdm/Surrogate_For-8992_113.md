<dt>description</dt><dd>This file is used to track the content and interactions with an alert.<br/>Every alert which is generated is initially filed within this file.  Each<br/>entry has the date and time the alert was generated, which user generated<br/>the alert, whether the alert was generated in a background task, what<br/>action was to be taken if any (the entry point or option name to be used)<br/>and the data string, if any, for use with the alert.  There is a multiple<br/>field which also identifies each user that the alert was sent to, and when<br/>the user initially saw the displayed text, when the alert was selected for<br/>processing, when the processing was completed, and when the alert was<br/>deleted after processing or associated with another user's processing, or<br/>when the alert was deleted by a clean-up operation.<br/> <br/>Unless a longer lifetime is specified for the specific alert, it will be<br/>deleted from the file after 30 days.  If a longer lifetime is specified,<br/>it will not be deleted until after that period passes.</dd>

| recipient_type | .01 | Recipient Type | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to track how a specific recipient was selected for <br/>receiving the alert. The initial recipients are those to whom the alert<br/>was initially directed (INITIAL RECIPIENT).  Other recipients may be the<br/>result of forwarding.  Recipients of the alert from forwarding are noted<br/>by the type of forwarding involved (FWD BY USER, EMAIL SURROGATE,<br/>CHIEF/SUPERVISOR, BACKUP REVIEWER, or LAST HOPE).<br/> <br/>Marked as a specific category are those to whom the alert was directed,<br/>but who were not available to receive an alert due to lack of access<br/>(marked with the suffix \-UNDELIVERABLE\ added to the basis for the <br/>alert being sent to the user).<br/> <br/>Those who have alerts forwarded to their surrogate or receive the alert <br/>while acting as a surrogate for another user are indicated by entries in <br/>fields #.02 (SENT TO SURROGATE) and #.03 (ACTING AS SURROGATE), <br/>respectively.  In addition, those who are acting as surrogates are <br/>identified in the current field by the suffix \-SURROGATE\ added to the <br/>basis for the alert being received.  Since the recipient may be acting as <br/>surrogate for more than one user, the actual users for which the message <br/>was sent on a surrogate basis are indicated in the SURROGATE FOR sub-file <br/>(#8992.113) under the RECIPIENT sub-file.<br/> <br/>The values stored for this field are pointers to entries in the ALERT <br/>RECIPIENT TYPE file (#8992.2).{:/} | POINTER |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED | Alert_Recipient_Type-8992_2 |

| acting_as_surrogate | .03 | Acting As Surrogate | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to identify those recipients who were sent the alert <br/>because they were selected as an active surrogate for the originally <br/>intended user.

| forwarded_date_time | .01 | Forwarded Date/time | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to track the date/time of forwarding of the alert to <br/>this recipient.  This is a multiple field to track instances in which <br/>multiple copies of the alert may be forwarded to a single recipient for<br/>various reasons.  This multiple field will indicate when it was forwarded<br/>and the basis for forwarding of the alert.{:/} | DATE-TIME |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| forwarding_category | .02 | Forwarding Category | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to track the basis on which the alert is forwarded to <br/>the current recipient.  The alert might be forwarded to the recipient by <br/>a user directly, or by programmed forwarding related to alerts not being <br/>processed within a specified time to EMAIL SURROGATE, CHIEF/SUPERVISOR; <br/>BACKUP REVIEWER, or LAST RESORT.<br/> <br/>Entries for this field are pointers to the values in the ALERT RECIPIENT <br/>TYPE file (#8992.2).{:/} | POINTER |  |  | Alert_Recipient_Type-8992_2 |
