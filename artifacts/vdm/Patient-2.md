<dt>description</dt><dd>The PATIENT file contains all the patients followed by the medical center/<br/>Outpatient clinic.  At a minimum each patient entry must have a NAME, DATE<br/>OF BIRTH and SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  In order to add a new patient to the<br/>PATIENT file the user must also indicate whether or not the patient is<br/>requesting to receive care as a VETERAN of the U.S. Armed Forces and<br/>specify the TYPE of patient being added to the system.  For the most<br/>part the information contained in this file is demographic in nature,<br/>i.e., address, employment, service history, etc., however data<br/>concerning admissions, appointments,etc., is also stored in this file.<br/>The ADMISSION sub-field is scheduled to be moved into the new PATIENT<br/>MOVEMENT file by the end of calendar year 1989.  Care should be used<br/>when removing a patient from the PATIENT file since virtually all<br/>other DHCP modules do utilize data from this file.  Of the many fields<br/>in the file you will note that many are preceeded by an asterisk.<br/>Those fields are scheduled to be removed from the file due to either<br/>lack of use or replacement by another field/file in the next release.</dd>
