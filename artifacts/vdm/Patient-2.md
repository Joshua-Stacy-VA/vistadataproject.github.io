 description | The PATIENT file contains all the patients followed by the medical center/\rOutpatient clinic.  At a minimum each patient entry must have a NAME, DATE\rOF BIRTH and SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  In order to add a new patient to the\rPATIENT file the user must also indicate whether or not the patient is\rrequesting to receive care as a VETERAN of the U.S. Armed Forces and\rspecify the TYPE of patient being added to the system.  For the most\rpart the information contained in this file is demographic in nature,\ri.e., address, employment, service history, etc., however data\rconcerning admissions, appointments,etc., is also stored in this file.\rThe ADMISSION sub-field is scheduled to be moved into the new PATIENT\rMOVEMENT file by the end of calendar year 1989.  Care should be used\rwhen removing a patient from the PATIENT file since virtually all\rother DHCP modules do utilize data from this file.  Of the many fields\rin the file you will note that many are preceeded by an asterisk.\rThose fields are scheduled to be removed from the file due to either\rlack of use or replacement by another field/file in the next release.
