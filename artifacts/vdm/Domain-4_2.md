<dt>description</dt><dd>This file is used to name all of the domains to which MailMan messages<br/>may be routed.  Each name in this file corresponds to the right side<br/>of a MailMan address-the part following the \@\.<br/> <br/>Domains may have synonyms, allowing users to name sites with one name,<br/>while MailMan uses the more formal Domain Naming conventions.<br/> <br/>This file also controls whether messages are queued for immediate transmission<br/>and into what queue they are dropped.  Any domain may have a relay domain,<br/>which controls the routing as follows:<br/> <br/>If a domain has a named relay domain, the message is put in the queue for<br/>the relay domain.<br/> <br/>If not, and the domain has a TRANSMISSION SCRIPT, then the message is put<br/>in the queue for that domain.<br/> <br/>Otherwise, the message is put in the queue for the Parent domain, as defined<br/>at MailMan initialization time.</dd>

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| name | .01 | Name | {::nomarkdown}This name is the exact name of the domain, as used in network addressing.<br/>It consists of \.\ (dot) pieces that are formed hierarchically starting at<br/>the right.  Domains with dot pieces to the left are administered by the<br/>domain whose domain name consists of its name less the 1st dot piece.<br/>For example:  A.DOMAIN.COM is administered by DOMAIN.COM.<br/> <br/>The domain name may be from 1 to 64 characters.<br/><br/>Each dot piece may be up to 20 characters, and must begin with an alpha<br/>or numeric, and be composed of only alpha, numeric, or \-\ characters.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| flags | 1 | Flags | {::nomarkdown}The flags field controls the flow of messages to this domain from the<br/>local node.  Flags are:<br/> <br/>S = Send.  MailMan should start a TaskMan task to transmit the message<br/>as soon as the message is received.<br/> <br/>C = Close.  MailMan will not allow users to address mail to this domain.<br/> <br/>Q or \\ (the null string) = Queue.  MailMan will not deliver until a<br/>task is explicitly created to deliver the mail.<br/> <br/>P = Poll.  A TaskMan task will poll all domains with this flag.<br/> <br/>N = NO-forward.  MailMan will not allow messages to be forwarded to this<br/>domain.<br/> <br/>T = Talkman enabled.  The presence of this flag allows Talkman to be <br/>used at your site.  It is also necessary to put a 'T' command into<br/>the script so that TalkMan will be invoked properly.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  |

| new_validation_number | 1.61 | New Validation Number | {::nomarkdown}This field is used for security.

| disable_turn_command | 1.7 | Disable Turn Command | {::nomarkdown}This field, if set to \YES\, means that a remote domain calling this<br/>domain will not be able to execute the SMTP TURN command.  This means<br/>that the sending domain must open the link.

| transmission_script | .01 | Transmission Script | {::nomarkdown}This is the name of the transmission script.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| priority | 1 | Priority | {::nomarkdown}This field is used by MailMan to decide which script to play when trying<br/>to transmit messages in background.  The higher the number the lower the<br/>priority for being chosen.  See also the Number of Attempts field.<br/>When MailMan is transmitting using the TCP/IP Poller (XMRTCP), it<br/>assumes that there is only one  possible TCP/IP connection per domain and<br/>does not look for multiple scripts to roll over to.  This field is only<br/>operable for SMTP type scripts (using standard asynchronous WAN connections).<br/>PRIORITIES can go from 0 to 9999 where 0 is the highest and 9999 is the<br/>lowest.  If the field has no value, 9999 is assumed.{:/} | NUMERIC |  | INDEXED |  | 
| number_of_attempts | 1.1 | Number Of Attempts | {::nomarkdown}MailMan tests against this field to determine how many times it should<br/>try a particular protocol before giving up and trying the next one.<br/>This field is used in conjunction with the Priority field.  When the<br/>the Number of tries to transmit the messages in the queue exceeds the value<br/>of this field, a Transmission Failure bulletin is sent to the Postmaster.<br/>This field is only active with the SMTP type of transmission script.{:/} | NUMERIC |  |  |  | 
| type-1_2 | 1.2 | Type | {::nomarkdown}Each transmission script must be given a type so that it<br/>can be handled properly.<br/>asynchronous connections on the WAN are of the type IDCU.  These scripts<br/>may compete with each other according to their priorities (See the<br/>PRIORITY field).  Scripts that use TCP/IP channels should be marked<br/>with the type TCPCHAN so that they are ignored during prioritization<br/>unless the TCP/IP enabled CPUs have Task Manager running on them, in<br/>which case they should be made SMTP type.<br/> <br/>In other words, if the physical link is on a CPU that Task Manager runs<br/>on the transmission script can be of the type SMTP.  If it is not on such<br/>a CPU another type must be chosen.<br/> <br/>Other types are TELNET (used for TalkMan or other interactive scripts),<br/>FTP (for File Transfers) and Other.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>TCPCHAN</dt><dd>TCP/IP Channel</dd><dt>FTP</dt><dd>File Transfer Protocol</dd><dt>TELNET</dt><dd>Interactive / TalkMan</dd><dt>SMTP</dt><dd>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</dd><dt>OTHER</dt><dd>OTHER</dd></dl>{:/} |
