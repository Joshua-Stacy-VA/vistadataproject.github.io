The movement that physically occurs<br/>first (the transfer in the first example, and the discharge in the second)<br/>will have a sequence number of 1 while the subsequent movement will have<br/>a sequence number of 2.  This number (divided by 100000000) will be added<br/>to the date/time of the movement to aid in cross-referencing these<br/>movements.  This is intended to make code generation quicker.
