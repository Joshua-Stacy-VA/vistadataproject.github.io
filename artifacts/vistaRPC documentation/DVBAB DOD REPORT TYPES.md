 description | This remote procedure call returns a list of available report types.  The RPC is designed specifically for the FHIE VistA server not the local VAMC facilities.  It is distributed nationally with the CAPRI application to keep the remote procedures and the DVBA CAPRI GUI option consistent on all systems using CAPRI.  Please do not use.
