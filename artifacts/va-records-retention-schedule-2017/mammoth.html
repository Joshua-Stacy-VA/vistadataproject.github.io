PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The Records Control Schedule (RCS) 10-1 provides Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records retention and disposition requirements for VHA Central Office, Program Offices, and field facilities.  The primary purpose of this revision is to incorporate changes to RCS 10-1 issued since the last publication date of March 20, 2017. The schedule is divided into eight chapters.  Each chapter covers a group of records, e.g., chapter one covers administrative records.  The first four chapters include most of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules (GRS).  Space for additional records schedules is available to allow for future expansion.  The VHA Records Management Office intends to update this schedule every three years in order to publish the most up to date records management requirements.  Between updates the VHA Records Management Office will post new or revised schedules on the HIM/RM (Health Information Management/Records Management) website.  Schedules are not required to be in the RCS 10-1 to be a legal schedule. Once a schedule is approved by the Archivist of the United States it must be used to manage the agency’s records.</p><p><strong>2. INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p>a. Title 44, Section 3301, of the United States (U.S.) Code defines records as “all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials or other documentary materials, regardless of the physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the U.S. Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the government or because of the information value of data in them.  Library and museum material made or</p><p>acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents preserved only for convenience or reference, and stocks of publications and of processed documents are not included. These items are referred to as non-record materials.</p><p>b. The VHA Records Control Schedule (RCS) 10-1 is the main authority for the retention and disposition requirements of VHA records.  It provides a brief description of the records and states the retention period and disposition requirements.  It also provides the NARA disposition authorities or the GRS authorities, whichever is appropriate for the records, in addition to program and service sections.</p><p>c. The GRS provides disposal authorities for temporary administrative records common to all Federal agencies.  It covers records relating to: personnel, budget and finance, procurement, information technology, and other common functions and activities of Federal agencies.  Any deviation from the GRS must be authorized by NARA in accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1228.42(B).  Requests for deviations from either the RCS 10-1 or GRS</p><p>retention and disposition requirements are to be submitted to the VHA Records Management Office via the Facility requesting the change and the primary VHA Program Office with authority over the record type that is being requested for change.</p><p><strong>3. RECORDS MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><p>a. The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Informatics and Analytics (10P2), Executive Director Information Governance (10P2C) Health Information Management/Records Management Office will be referred to as the VHA Records Management Office throughout this document.  The VHA Records Management Office is responsible for developing policies and procedures for effective and efficient records management throughout VHA including VHA Program Offices and Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Centers. In addition, the Office acts as the liaison between VHA and NARA on issues pertaining to records management practices and procedures.</p><p>b. VHA Field/Facility Records Managers are responsible for all records management activities at their site.</p><p>c. All VHA employees are responsible for ensuring that records are created, maintained, protected, and dispositioned in accordance with NARA regulations and VA policies and procedures.</p><p><strong>4. DISPOSITION OF RECORDS</strong></p><p>The RCS 10-1 contains retention and disposition requirements for VHA records authorized by NARA or assigned a GRS authority.  Record disposition refers to the transfer of records to an approved records storage facility, transfer of permanent records to NARA, the destruction of records, or other appropriate actions to dispose of records.  Unless retrieved; records transferred to a storage facility shall be dispositioned after expiration of their retention requirements.</p><p><strong>5. PERMANENT AND UNSCHEDULED RECORDS</strong></p><p>Permanent and unscheduled records in VHA custody must be reported through the VHA Records Management Office to NARA.  Permanent (archival) records are defined as records appraised by NARA to have sufficient historical value or other value to warrant permanent preservation at the NARA.  Un-appraised and unscheduled records are records that have not been evaluated to determine their record retention or disposition.  Such records are to be retained until they receive disposition authority from NARA.  The VHA Program Offices responsible for unscheduled records shall work with the Field/Facility Records Manager, VHA Records Management Office and the VHA Records Officer to identify, describe and submit to NARA a request for disposition authority using the NARA electronic Records Archives (ERA) system.</p><p><strong>6. MEDIA NEUTRAL RECORDS</strong></p><p>a. A media neutral schedule item on a records disposition schedule (i.e., SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority or NARA Electronic Records Archives (ERA) records scheduling module)  applies to the described records regardless of their medium.  Program offices must submit a new schedule request through the VHA Records Management Office to NARA for approval of electronic versions of previously scheduled records if:</p><p>(1) The content and function of the records have changed significantly (e.g., the electronic records contain information that is substantially different from the information included in the hard copy series or are used for different purposes).</p><p>(2) The previously approved schedule explicitly excluded electronic records.</p><p>(3) The electronic records consist of program records maintained on an agency Web site. (4) The electronic records consist of temporary program records maintained in a format</p><p>other than scanned image AND the previously approved schedule is not media neutral.</p><p>b. Temporary still pictures, sound recordings, motion picture film, and video recordings.  Apply the previously approved schedule to digital versions.</p><p>c. Scanned images of temporary records, including temporary program records.  Apply the previously approved schedule.</p><p>d. Other temporary records maintained in an electronic format other than scanned images:</p><p>(1) For temporary records that are covered by an item in the GRS (other than those GRS items that exclude electronic master files and databases) or an agency-specific schedule that pertains to administrative housekeeping activities, apply the previously approved schedule.  If the electronic records consist of information drawn from multiple hard copy series, apply the previously approved schedule item with the longest retention period.  This is common when creating an electronic system that replaces a number of paper and electronic record types.  The older systems and paper records are now placed into a new system.  In the past these records may have covered various disposition life cycles. In the case of finance records the range could have been from one to six years.  If the records in the new electronic system cannot be dispositioned separately then they must be kept for the longest disposition, in this case six years.</p><p>(2) For temporary program records covered by a NARA-approved media neutral schedule item (i.e., the item appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval before December 17, 2007, that is explicitly stated to be media neutral, or it appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval on or after December 17, 2007, that is not explicitly limited to a specific recordkeeping medium), are considered media neutral.  An example of this is the Health Records Folder File or Consolidated Health Record (CHR).  The original NARA approved records disposition schedule</p><p>was NARA (Job No. N1-15-91-6 item 1).  This schedule was written and approved in 1991 and was for the paper health record only.  In 2000 (VHA) created an “Electronic Health Record”. Since this record was not paper VHA was required to submit to NARA a request for an electronic record schedule NARA (Job No.N1-15-02-3).  This records schedule was created in</p><p>2002 which makes both the paper and electronic health record media neutral for future changes.</p><p><strong>7. DAMAGE TO AND UNAUTHORIZED DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS</strong></p><p>a. VHA records shall not be disposed of without the proper authorization to do so.  Federal law prohibits unauthorized destruction or mutilation of Federal records.  The penalty for such acts is a $2,000 fine, 3 years in prison, or both pursuant to Title 18 United States Code 2071.  Damage to, and unauthorized destruction of records is to be reported to the VHA Records Office immediately upon knowledge of such an act of destruction.</p><p>b. VHA officials must take measures to ensure that records are not disposed of improperly. Records are not to be removed from VHA custody or destroyed without regard to the requirements of this schedule or the GRS.  When records are improperly disposed, NARA regulations and VA policy require the submission of a report to NARA.  The report must include the record description, volume, date of incident, etc.  Specific reporting requirements are contained in NARA regulations, Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1228, Disposition of Federal Records, and VA Handbook 6300.1, Chapter 6., Records Management Procedures.</p><p><strong>8. RECORDS FREEZES/LITIGATION HOLDS</strong></p><p>a. Records freeze:  Records whose scheduled disposition has been temporarily suspended because of special circumstances that alter the administrative, legal, or fiscal value of the records.</p><p>b. Litigation hold:  The Office of General Counsel (OGC) may periodically issue a litigation hold or moratorium on the disposition of certain records because the records may be potentially responsive or helpful in ongoing or pending litigation (lawsuits).</p><p>c. A &quot;hold&quot; is simply the implementation of a litigation hold notice issued by an OGC Office. Upon receipt, the records manager must suspend the normal disposition cycle of the records</p><p>listed in the hold notice to prevent their early/premature disposal.  Holds are placed on records in an agency's physical custody.</p><p>d. A &quot;freeze&quot; is created when the records manager receives a hold notice for records not in the agency’s physical custody but in the custody of the VA Records Center and Vault (RC&amp;V), a Federal Record Center (FRC), or a commercial records storage facility.  The Facility Records Manager would ask NARA to create a freeze to halt premature disposition of the records.  Since most litigations deal with relatively current agency activity, the number of freezes is significantly smaller than the number of holds since the agency still has physical custody of most records affected by holds.</p><p>e. Upon receipt of a hold notice the records manager should initiate a freeze on any off-site records in conjunction with the hold placed on the on-site records in physical custody.  This ensures that any potentially responsive record is preserved regardless of its physical location.</p><p>f. The Office of General Counsel maintains a list of litigation holds at the following website: OGC Litigation Share Point:  <a href="https://vaww.ogc.vaco.portal.va.gov/litigation/Lists/active/AllItems.aspx">https://vaww.ogc.vaco.portal.va.gov/litigation/Lists/active/AllItems.aspx</a></p><p>g. Additional information may be found at the following NARA website:</p><p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/frc/arcis/freeze-faq.pdf">http://www.archives.gov/frc/arcis/freeze-faq.pdf</a></p><p><strong>9. VITAL/ESSENTIAL RECORDS</strong></p><p>Vital/Essential records are defined as essential records needed to maintain the continuity of Federal government activities during and following a national emergency or a technological or natural disaster and to protect the rights and interests of VA beneficiaries and employees. Additional information can be found in VA Handbook 6300.2.</p><p><strong>10. PERSONAL PAPERS</strong></p><p>Personal papers consist of documents that relate only to an individual’s personal affairs and do not affect the conduct of government business.  Examples of personal papers are diaries, journals or other personal notes that are not created in the process of transacting government business. Personal papers may be disposed of in accordance with the owner’s preference.  Note: Personal notes included on an official calendar or files are subject to official records authorities.</p><p><strong>11. TERMINATION OF OFFICE/SERVICE AND DEACTIVATION OF FIELD FACILITY</strong></p><p>a.  Specific records management procedures are to be followed when terminating an office/service or deactivating a field facility.  The procedures are contained in VA Handbook</p><p>6300.1.  It is important to follow these procedures to prevent the loss or unauthorized destruction of VHA records.</p><p>b.  Once it has been determined to abolish an office/service or to deactivate a field facility, the office or facility records manager is to be consulted so that certain measures are taken to prevent the premature destruction of records.  An evaluation is to be conducted to determine those records that are eligible for immediate destruction, identify records that are to be transferred to the successor office/service or facility, identify records that are eligible for transfer to a records</p><p>storage facility, and identify records of permanent value to be offered to the NARA.  Records are not to be disposed of without proper authority to do so.</p><p><strong>12. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) POLICY</strong></p><p>a. VA Directive 6300, <em>Records and Information Management, </em>provides the policy for records and information management.</p><p>b. VA Handbook 6300.1, <em>Records Management Procedures, </em>specifies procedures for implementing the records management program.</p><p>c. VA Handbook 6300.2, <em>Management of the Vital Records Pro</em>g<em>ram</em>, implements the VA Vital</p><p>Records Program which is an integral component of the VA Emergency Preparedness Plan.</p><p>d. VA Handbook 6300.8, <em>Procedures for Shipment of Records to the RC&amp;V in Neosho, Missouri</em>, provides procedures for transferring records to the RC&amp;V.</p><p><strong>PART TWO</strong></p><p><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></p><p><strong>GENERAL ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT RECORDS</strong></p><p><strong>1000-1999</strong></p><p><strong>The records described in this chapter pertain to performance of office and other administrative management functions throughout VHA CO, Program Offices and facilities and to techniques and programs that develop, control and improve management processes. These techniques and programs relate to the organization and planning, management analysis, acquisition program management, office methods, records, forms, reports and publication management, data processing; inspections, management sciences, and overall management of programs.</strong></p><p><strong>1000-1099</strong></p><p><strong>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION GRS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATION</strong></p><p><strong>1000</strong></p><p><strong>Records Common to Most Offices within Agencies</strong></p><p><strong>(GRS-23)</strong></p><p><strong>1000.1.  This schedule provides for the disposal of certain records common to most offices in Federal agencies.

Item 1 may not be applied to files that also contain program records and may not be applied by an office that receives and takes action on documents submitted by other offices.</strong></p><p><strong>a.	Office Administration Files: Records accumulated by individual offices that relate to the internal administration or housekeeping</strong></p><p><strong>activities of the office rather than the functions for which the office exists.

Most of these records are administrative housekeeping records. Agencies create and maintain administrative records when carrying out general, non-mission-related activities that keep an office operating. In contrast, agencies create mission records when carrying out the unique activities for which the agency was established. The only mission-related records this schedule covers are non-recordkeeping copies of electronic records</strong></p><p><strong>(item 020) that are maintained for decision-making purposes or taking action. Copies maintained solely for convenience of reference are considered non-record materials. This schedule may be applied to records in offices that carry out mission-related activities, but only those records that are described here.</strong></p><p><strong>This schedule does not apply to transitory records,</strong></p><p><strong>which are scheduled in GRS 5.2. The distinction between transitory and the records covered in this schedule is that the records here generally have a longer period of business use than transitory records. This schedule also does not cover materials an agency determines to be non-record or personal.

Included within the scope of the schedule are disposable records created in the course of organizational planning, development, and simplification of procedures; records management activities; and administration of management improvement programs. GRS 1 (Items 12 and</p><p>13) provide for the disposition of case files on individuals involved in incentive award and similar types of management improvement programs. Any records created prior to January 1, 1939, must be offered NARA before applying these disposition instructions.</p><p>The organizational locations and titles of administrative management units vary from agency to agency. They may be scattered at numerous levels or locations, or may be centralized. For the purposes of this schedule, the nomenclature standards set forth by the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments (replaces Senate Committee on Government Operations) in Senate Report 243 (replaces 245), 80th Congress, 1st session, are followed: the first organizational level within an agency is the bureau level; subordinate components are, successively, division, branch, section, and unit.</p><p>This schedule is based on the presumption that management activities are carried on by a specialized person or unit with, at least, division-wide and usually bureau-wide or agency-wide responsibilities or by a group of such persons or units in an agency, although its provisions are applicable to exactly comparable records of</p><p>agencies without such formal assignments of responsibility. Many similar or comparable records created at lower organizational levels or in field offices vary so greatly in content, value, and arrangement that they are not covered</p><p>by this schedule.</p><p>Because of the nature of the activities documented by administrative management records, a relatively large proportion of them are of continuing value. Files with potential archival value are not covered by the GRS. They must be scheduled individually by submission of a Standard Form (SF) 115 to NARA. These records include</p><p>organizational charts and reorganization studies, functional statements, delegations of authority, and agency histories. However, related temporary or ephemeral materials include working papers that do not have a direct bearing on the transaction, intermediate drafts of documents and</p><p>worksheets that do not represent significant basic steps in the preparation of final drafts, letters or memoranda of Transmittal and acknowledgment, routing slips, and extra copies of documents.</p><p><strong>1003.1.  Administrative Issuances. </strong>[See note after item</p><p>1b.]</p><p>a.

Records relate to such activities as determining that a PKI should be established; creating project implementation plans; creating the certificate policy (CP), certification practice statement (CPS), and other key operating documents; developing procedures in accordance with the CP and CPS; conducting risk analyses; developing records management policies (including migration strategies); and selecting the entity</p><p>that will serve as registration authority (RA). Stand-up configuration and validation records relate to installing and validating both the Certification Authority (CA) and Registration Authority (RA), obtaining final approval or rejection from the agency's oversight or authorizing body, creating and generating a CA signature key, testing security procedures for the CA and RA, validating certification revocation procedures, and establishing back-up and</p><p>storage for the PKI system.

Records relate to transaction-specific records that are generated for each transaction using PKI digital signature technology. Records are embedded or referenced within the transaction stream and may be appended to the transaction content or information record.

Destruction of the transaction-specific and administrative records embedded</p><p>in the transaction stream prior to the authorized retention of the information record that they access/protect will render the PKI incapable of performing what it is designed to do- protect and provide access to the information record. Due</p><p>to the relative newness of PKI technology, both from an implementation and a litigation perspective, it is recommended that agencies identify all PKI transaction records (including PKI select administrative records embedded in the transaction stream and transaction-specific</p><p>records) to be retained as part of the trust documentation for the records the PKI is designed to protect and or access and link the retention of the transaction records with that of the information record it protects/accesses.

This schedule applies to the pay records that are common to all agencies, but it excludes (a) retirement records (Standard Form (SF) 2806 or equivalent) that are maintained during employee duty and then transferred to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); (b) files maintained in agency space for audit by the</p><p>General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S.C.</p><p>3529(c); (c) records relating to tax withholding, savings bonds, fidelity bonds, or other records held by the appropriate units of the Treasury Department responsible for the related Government-wide programs; and (d) Office</p><p>of Management and Budget files reflecting agency personnel needs and problems. The NARA must be consulted for any records created prior to January 1, 1921 before applying these disposition instructions.</p><p>Documents required by the Comptroller General to be maintained for site audit are segments of accountable officer's accounts. In no event may disposal be made of records pertaining to accounts, claims, or demands involving the Government of the United States which have not been settled or adjusted by the GAO unless the agency concerned has written approval of the Comptroller General, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3309. Most Federal civilian pay accounts are prepared and maintained in accordance with Title 6 - Pay, Leave, and Allowances and incorporated in the GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies.</p><p>In the payrolling process different types of records are accumulated. Under Title 6 of the GAO Manual these records are normally site-audited on a sample basis by GAO representatives who examine primarily the earnings record card, payroll change slips that are prepared to document changes in normal pay, certification sheets containing the signatures of the certifying officer, checklists prepared in lieu of the more formal payrolls by Department of the Treasury or local disbursing personnel, source personnel documents such as basic time and attendance reports, and copies of personnel action forms documenting changes in pay. In addition, pay registers and other accounting devices are maintained to check and balance the accounts.</p><p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: All payroll systems require the maintenance of a leave record used to submit data to the payroll system. Information is posted to this record from more detailed records kept by time and attendance clerks located throughout an agency.

(GRS-5)</strong></p><p>Budget and apportionment records include the various files accumulated in an agency in the course of formulating its budget for submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and to the Congress; in defending its requests for funds before both bodies; and after enactment of an appropriation bill, in ensuring that the funds are used in such a way as to suffice for the appropriate period of time. The funds are made available to the agency by OMB, usually in quarterly portions, and the agencies must</p><p>indicate and justify regularly to OMB their proposed rate of expenditure. After the funds have been made available to</p><p>the agency, its own controls over the funds are in its expenditure accounting records (Schedule 7), and detailed information relative to expenditures is contained in the accountable officers' accounts (Schedule 6).</p><p>This schedule applies to certain records of budget preparation and apportionment in all agencies, but does not apply to records of OMB and the Department of Treasury reflecting the Government-wide budget responsibilities of those agencies. Records created prior to January 1, 1921, must be offered to the NARA before applying the disposition instructions.</p><p>Agency budget records are normally created at all levels of agency organization. They show proposals from all operating levels as well as the bureau-wide and agency- wide coordinating work done by formally organized budget offices. Therefore the records consist of detailed work papers and budgetary statements developed by single operating units, the more significant budget statements and related papers representing consolidated submissions prepared at the bureau or equivalent level and forwarded to</p><p>the agency budget officer, and the records at the highest level pertaining to the budget submission for the entire agency.</p><p>The nature of the budget presentation itself is standardized by OMB which prescribes format and procedures for all Federal agencies. However, the internal reports and papers which support the budget and are used in its preparation vary from agency to agency. The budget submission, a record copy of which is usually designated by the agency,</p><p>is a duplicate of the set of papers submitted to OMB. These include summary statements of appropriations and expenditures, statements of contract authorizations, and statements of receipts as well as narrative summary statements which highlight the principal features of the agency requests and immediately related supporting documents. The narrative presents the policies and the programs of the agency which the budgetary requests are to support. In addition to the summaries, the submission includes schedules of obligations and statements pertaining to each type of appropriation and fund under which the individual agency operates. Finally, OMB requires additional supporting data pertaining to objects of expenditure, particular agency programs, and figures based on the cost of various type of service operations, such as personnel and payrolling activities.</p><p><strong>4100.1.

Depending on agency recordkeeping practices and patterns of documentation, these records may have archival value and must be scheduled by submitting a Standard Form 115 to NARA.

The basic procurement files reflect a considerable range of procedure, from simple, small purchases to complicated prime contractor and subcontractor operations.</p><p>Any records created prior to 1895 must first be offered to the NARA for appraisal before applying the disposal instructions. Frequently copies of procurement papers become integral parts of the other files in the agency, such as project files of various types or general subject files pertaining to program operations; such copies are not covered by this schedule because they cannot be considered and evaluated separately from the files of which they are a part.</p><p>The General Accounting Office (GAO) no longer requires agencies to maintain a separate file of contracts for site audit. The agency contract files maintained in the contracting officer's office are accessible to GAO auditors and have generally been used by them in the past.</p><p>When a claim is filed by or against the Government, records relating to the claim should be retained without regard to the otherwise applicable records retention schedules which would have authorized destruction of the records prior to the time when the claim is finally resolved unless the agency has received written approval from the GAO (44 U.S.C. Section 3309 and 62 Comp. Gen. 42 (1982)). A claim is finally resolved: (1) when it is disallowed and the time for appealing the denial or instituting suit on the claim has expired; or (2) when it is allowed and paid or the amount offered in compromise is accepted and paid; or (3) when the amount found due and owing proves uncollectible because time limits for collecting the indebtedness through legal proceedings or by way of setoff have expired.</p><p>Records documenting procurement and supply in the agencies are largely standardized by various regulations of the Comptroller General and the Administrator of General Services. The physical arrangement of the transaction files themselves differs in the various agencies, however. In all agencies the official contract files, for example, contain a minimum core of specified documents, but there are also other documents that vary in accordance with what the individual agency deems to be best for its own operating purposes.</p><p>The key procurement file is the transaction case file containing the formal contract or informal purchase order or lease instruments and all related papers. The documents flowing into the transaction file differ in detail, but they include, in addition to the purchase document, specifications, bids, schedules of delivery, the initiating requisition, invoices, and correspondence. Other copies of these documents, made for expediting and other administrative purposes, are scattered throughout the inspection, shipping, expediting, and other units of the agency procurement organization.</p><p>Other files related to the procurement and supply function include reports used for supply management purposes by the agency creating the records as well as the staff agency involved with Government-wide programs. They also include local requisition and stock inventory files and other minor supply papers. Of a specialized character in the procurement field are the title papers documenting the acquisition of real property (by purchase, condemnation, donation, exchange, or otherwise). These papers are required by the Government as long as the property</p><p>remains in Government hands or if it has been sold or released -- conditionally or with recapture clauses. When properties are disposed of by quitclaim deeds, this fact should be confirmed prior to the disposal of title papers, since the title evidence might be needed by the Government to defend the title in the event the properties were disposed of by deeds containing general or special warranties.</p><p>It should also be ascertained that the title evidence relates only to the properties which were sold by the Government. In many instances, lands acquired by the Government are disposed of in different size parcels, and if the Government retains the title to any portion the title evidence should be retained.</p><p>This schedule does not apply to Interior Department records relating to the public domain or to the title opinion files of the Department of Justice.</p><p>This schedule includes some of the common agency records relating to grant programs. Since many Federal agencies conduct grant programs which document projects</p><p>contracted between the agency and an outside party, these records are included as an adjunct to the procurement and supply records.</p><p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Many of the record disposition schedules in GRS-</p><p>3 have been changed by the GRS record disposition schedules in GRS 1.1 in Chapter 4 of this manual.]</p><p><strong>5000.1.

These probabilities can then be summed for all surgical procedures performed by the VHA surgical programs to arrive</strong></p><p><strong>at an expected number of events (mortality, morbidity) for all operations including the following surgical specialties: cardiac surgery, general surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, urology, and vascular surgery. The observed number of events (O) divided by the expected number of events (E) produces the O/E ratio for the procedures performed at any single VA medical center.
