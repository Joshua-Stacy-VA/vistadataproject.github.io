When the lab defines this printerthe priority notification will print on this device so the lab user knowswhich results were not printed at the requesting location and still need tobe called. Remember the Review New Results option will electronically notifythe HCP of all results and designate priority results.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>hiv testing poc</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of the person responsible for HIV testing.
