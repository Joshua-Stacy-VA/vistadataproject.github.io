The entries point to the User file, and this file may be thought of as an extension of it. There are numerous fields that deal with user preferences.  There are also 4 subfiles, containing multiple entries for View Text, and Patient Lists, Patient Text & Topics, and Macro Commands. There are multiple cross-references which contain dynamic data related to Desktop functions, such as the last Desktop list, what user is currently in the Desktop, what user has locked their desktop, etc. Each user accessible field has help text associated with it, that can be reviewed from within the Desktop via the Help action.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>CH</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the Clinical User, which is the same as the User as defined in the User file # 3.</td></tr><tr><td>1.01</td><td>control mode</td><td>1;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:COMMAND LINE<br/>1:ACTION BAR<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used by Desktop to set up the initial Control Mode. If it is not set or set to COMMAND LINE", then the user will  Select Actions by typing a command, then pressing Enter. If it is set to ACTION BAR, then the user will Select Actions by  moving the cursor over the items, or pressing the first character  of the item.
