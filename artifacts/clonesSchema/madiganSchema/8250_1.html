Hirschmann, Pharm. D.,retaining some very important relationships between the ingredient and itsintended therapeutic use.The HIC is a six byte, alpha-numeric field utilizing the following format:Position Format       Description   1     Alpha        Identifies Organ System   2     Numeric      Pos. 1-2 Identifies Pharmacological Class   3     Alpha        Pos. 1-3 Identifies Therapeutic Class   4     Alpha        Pos. 1-6 identifies Ingredient   5     Alpha/Space  Pos. 5-6 identifies salt/ester   6     Alpha/Space  Pos. 5-6 identifies salt/esterThe fifth and sixth positions are either both alphabetic or both blank.All six positions uniquely identify an ingredient. The inherent structure ofthe HIC provides additional information about the ingredient:Typically the first four characters of the HIC uniquely identify an ingredientwith the last two characters containing blanks. When an ingredient comes inmore than one salt form, the 5th and 6th positions identify the salt/ester.Examples are hydrochloride (HC), sodium (NA), sulfate (SU) or phosphate (PH).When a salt/ester code is applicable, all six positions of the HIC arerequired to identify the ingredient, with the first four identifying the baseingredient.  For instance:"H3AH  "  =    Codeine "H3AHPH"  =    Codeine PhosphateWhen an ingredient has one and only one salt form, the salt ester code is leftblank, the first four characters identifying the complete ingredient.Procainamide Hydrochloride is an example of this, where the HIC is "A2AB ".The significance of the salt ester portion of the HIC is that a fourthrelationship, between base ingredient and its salt and/or ester forms, ismaintained.The HIC maintains the relationship of the ingredient to its intendedtherapeutic class (First DataBank's Specific Therapeutic Class - GC3,alias HIC3).  Further, the ingredient also identifies the pharmacologicalclass and organ system targeted by the intended use of the drug product.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>hicdesc</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>H</td><td>HIC Description ia a 50-byte description of the ingredient.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>castbl</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The Chemical Abstract Registry Number (CASTBL) contains the Chemical AbstractService Registry number. Up to four eight byte segments are included formulti-ingredient products. The CAS is zero filled on the left to eight byteswhen the assigned registry number is less than eight characters.  The default value of 99999999 is used for natural products and other ingredientsthat have not been assigned a CAS number by the registry.The sequence of CAS numbers is presented in the same order as in the GenericName (GNN) field.This field is intended to identify the CAS number of a chemical ingredient ofa drug product. It should not be used to group generically equivalent products.For these latter purposes the user is referred to the Generic Code Number(GCNSEQNO).  The user is encouraged to use the HICL, or ICNSE fields foringredient identification, since many drug ingredients are not assigned a CASnumber.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>dactbl</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8250_2.html">8250.2</a></td><td>D</td><td>Drug Allergy Codes (DAC) are used to identify and create warnings associatedwith the use of certain drugs in patients with a history of hypersensitivityto a particular drug or drug class.
