Procedure classes are used as ameans of grouping similar procedures for the purpose of assigningthem duplicate checking, order approval, and report verificationparameters. NOTE:  All procedures must be assigned to a procedure class.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>supervising radiologist</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="6.html">6</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of a staff radiologist who is qualified to verifyreports for all procedures assigned to this procedure class. This field is used in conjunction with the second signaturefunctionality.  If the following conditions have been met:  1)   the radiology reports reach a status of PRELIMINARY (that is,      they have been interpreted by a resident), and 2)   they have been in the supervising radiologist's queue for a      site-defined number of days without being verified,  the CHCS pulls these reports from the supervising radiologist'squeue and places them in the queue of the staff radiologistidentified in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>type of class(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field defines the duplicate checking, order approval, andverification parameters for procedures that fall within thisprocedure class. Enter any one of the following codes:  D   for duplicate checking only O   for order approval only R   for report verification only DO  for duplicate checking and order approval DR  for duplicate checking and report verification OR  for order approval and report verification DOR for duplicate checking, order approval, and reportverification. Set this field to D and the CHCS will perform duplicate checking onall procedures within this procedure class.  If a procedure isassigned to a procedure class on which duplicate checking isperformed, then during order entry the CHCS checks the currentpatient's Exam file entries to see if a radiology exam in thisprocedure class has been ordered for this patient within thesite-specified number of days.  If a duplicate is found the CHCSdisplays a warning message stating such.  This warning message canbe overridden. Set this field to O and the CHCS will require order approval forprocedures in this class.  When users order procedures in thisclass, the system displays a message stating that order approval isrequired.  The CHCS will allow radiologists who have this procedureclass in their ORDERING APPROVING CLASSES field to approve ordersfor procedures in this class. Set this field to R and the CHCS will allow verification of reportsby radiologists authorized to approve reports for procedures withinthis class.  The CHCS will allow radiologists who have this classin their REPORT APPROVING CLASSES field to verify reports forprocedure within this class. You may also combine any of the three settings so that one, two, orall three of these procedure class types may be assigned to aprocedure class.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>imaging type(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="79_2.html">79.2</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains the name of this type of imaging (for example,RADIOLOGY).</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>days to check for duplicates</td><td>0;11</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>                                        DUPLICATESEnter the number of days (from 0 to 365) you want the CHCS to checkthe patient's Exam file entries for duplicate ordered and/orperformed radiology procedures.  The CHCS checks for duplicateprocedures for the number of days prior to, on, and after the datethe newly ordered procedure is scheduled to be performed.</td></tr><tr><td>71</td><td>procedure</td><td>71;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="71_31.html">71.31</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name(s) of the procedure(s) to be included in thisprocedure class.  Assigning a procedure to a procedure classenables the CHCS, when the procedure is ordered, to perform thechecks as defined in the TYPE OF CLASS field. NOTE:  Every procedure must be assigned to a procedure class, butdo not assign a procedure to more than one procedure class.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
