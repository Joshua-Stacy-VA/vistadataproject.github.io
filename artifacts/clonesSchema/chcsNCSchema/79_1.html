The parameter switches allow the 'customizing' of themodule for each location by the radiology coordinator. Within a radiology division there may be a number of physical locationswhere a imaging procedure can be performed.  The module is designed tohandle multiple locations within a division.  However, each location canonly be associated with one division. </dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>location(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44.html">44</a></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the radiology location name (for example, MAIN RADIOLOGY). This field points to the Hospital Location file (#44).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>how many flash cards per exam</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>                                        EXAMEnter the number (from 0 to 10) of flash cards that the CHCS shouldprint for each radiologic exam performed in this location.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>flash card printer name</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3_5.html">3.5</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of the queueable device on which you want to printflash cards.
