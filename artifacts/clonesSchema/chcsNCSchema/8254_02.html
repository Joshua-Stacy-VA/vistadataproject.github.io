Each ingredient has an associated specific therapeutic class, related to either the HICTBL (8250.1)or optionally to the HICSEQNOHIC (8250), but each product entity (GCNSEQNOTBL-8254.02) has an associated specific therapeutic class.This therapeutic class coding scheme (HIC3) is the most specific offered by First DataBank and is intended for users who need a very definitive therapeuticclassification system.This data element is often used in FDB's Duplicate Therapy Checking module and FDB's Hierachical Ingredient Code List (HICL).  Contact FDB's customer service department for a copy of the specifications.For a complete listing of all of the HIC3 descriptions available check fileHIC1TBL HIC2TBL HIC3TBL (8250.3).  This file can be access using the HIC3 POINTER.</td></tr><tr><td>1.01</td><td>daclis</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains a list of allergy classes associated with the NDC numberassigned to a drug.</td></tr><tr><td>1.02</td><td>hiclis</td><td>1;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is a pointer to the HICLSEQNO file (#8250).

The smart key Route Code is atwo-digit number (with leading zeros removed) representing the route ofadministration.  An SKEY_RT code value is interpreted the same for all SKEYsubfields.  The SKEY_RT is compatible with the NDDF* one-character (GCRT) andtwo-character route (GCRT2), forming a one-to-one relationship with each.  Thecompatibility provides both downward and upward compatibility with existingNDDF* data.  The SKEY_RT allows the selection of route specific products withor without other SKEY subfield definitions, providing easy searches and easyformulary definitions.  If an SKEY_RT for an NDC is assigned zero, CHCS willassign it a numeric value by concatenating each ASCII character of the GCRTfield as its numeric equivalent $A().  All NDCs using the same two-characterroute description will point to the same value.  As First DataBank assigns anSKEY_RT to that route description, CHCS will change the SKEY_RT to reflect theassignment.Route of administration displays as part of the identifier of an NDC.  The 10-character Route Description (RT) found in the ROUTETBL is the fifth space-delimited parameter to display.  The NDC ID is formatted as NNNNN-NNNN-NN GNN(BN) STR RT GCDF.  The SKEY_RT on CHCS is a pointer to 8251.3 (ROUTETBL).  *NDDF is a Trade Mark of the Hearst Corporation.  </td></tr><tr><td>1.06</td><td>systemic</td><td>1;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>S:SYSTEMIC<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is a flag indicating whether a drug can be absorbed systemicallybased on the drug's route of administration.  This determination is basedsolely on the Primary NDC Number chosen for that drug and not on how the drugis defined in the CHCS Drug file (#50).  The systemic information originatesfrom First DataBank and is used to determine if classification overlap checkingshould be performed.</td></tr><tr><td>2.01</td><td>expand gnn</td><td>2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the drug ingredient names adopted by the USAN.  Thechemical name is used when the USAN name is not available.  Under FDB, becauseof space considerations, abbreviations were used in multi-ingredient products;for example, HCTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide), PP (Phenylpropanolamine), or CPM(Chlorpheniramine Maleate).  This field will NOT use these abbreviations, sincethe generic name is more explicit and easier to read.</td></tr><tr><td>3.01</td><td>dac mono lis</td><td>3;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>THIS of the list of allergy monographs that are needed on an allergy hit</td></tr><tr><td>4.01</td><td>damcslis</td><td>4;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a list of Cross Sensitivity Allergies Associated with this Drug.</td></tr><tr><td>5.01</td><td>adilise</td><td>5;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains a list of the drug's interaction codes originating fromFirst DataBank.
