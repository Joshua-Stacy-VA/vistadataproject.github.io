The attributes contained in each record or solely dependent on the NDC andnothing but the NDC.  Since the NDCTBL contains a foreign key attribute GCN Seq No, it is possible to link each NDC record directly to the CLINICAL entities.This latter association should be used with caution, since system performance can be degraded significantly with the multitude of indexes required for the NDCTBL foreign key associations.Every NDCTBL record (National Drug Code) contains a GCN Seq No, which allows the association of all NDC products with an identical combination of ingredients,  dosage form, route of administration and strength.The Internal entry number (D0) is the NDC Number with dashes and leading zerosremoved.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>PS</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>Number is the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for the NDCTBL file.  This IEN is the National Drug Code (NDC) with dashes and leading zeros removed.The NDC Number displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.  This primary IDdisplays its numeric value prepended with zeros to make it an eleven digitnumber with dashes added between the the fifth and sixth digit and ninth andtenth digit.  The NDC is the first space delimited parameter to display.  The NDC ID is formatted as NNNNN-NNNN-NN GNN (BN) STR RT GCDF.added to display as nnnnn-nnnn-nn.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>gcnseqno(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8251.html">8251</a></td><td>AGCN</td><td>The GCN Sequence Number is a random number representing the genericformulation.  It is specific to generic ingredient combination, route of administration, dosage form and drug strength. Also the GCN*SEQNO is the same across manufacturers and/or package sizes. However, the GCN*SEQNO is an absolutely unique number; it cannot be duplicated. The number by itself has no significance. No digit or group of digits within the GCN*SEQNO has any more significance than the rest of the number. However, it is very useful when used for online computer applications, such as generic substitution. The GCN*SEQNO can be used to group pharmaceutically equivalent products together. (Note: products having the same GCN*SEQNO are not necessarily bioequivalent.)</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>bn</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>BN</td><td>This description is usually the drug name appearing on the package label and frequently is a trademark. If necessary, it is edited to Fit space requirements. For non-branded generic products, the description will usually be the generic name.  This field is used as the descriptive product name in the "Blue Book" and "Price Alert" publications.Those users requiring a complete description of the drug product should alsouse the Additional Descriptor (AD) field.The Brand name displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.  This 30 character description displays only if it is different than the generic name.When it displays it is the third space delimited parameter surrounded byparenthesis.  The NDC ID is formatted as NNNNN-NNNN-NN GNN (BN) STR RT GCDF.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>ad</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field provides, when necessary, additional information used to distinguish a drug product record such as color or type, trademarked dosage forms, special packaging or other unique characteristics.  When no such distinguishing characteristics exist, the field is blank.First DataBank has found it useful to standardize some of the terms used in this field.  Users can then know that, even if these terms must be abbreviatedto fit in the AD field, they will always contain a precise search "string, "which may be used for customized applications.  Following is a current list of all of the standardized terms:AD Term         Search StringADD-VANTAGE     =       ADD-VANSTERI-VIAL      =       STERI-VSTERI-DOSE      =       STERI-DREDI VIAL       =       REDI VU-D     =       U-DThis field is usually used in conjunction with the Brand Name (BN). </td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>ln</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the label name.  The label name is a combination of thedrug name appearing on the package label, the strength description, and thedosage form description.  Abbreviations of the dosage form, strength and/ordrug name are used when necessary to conform to the space limitations of 30characters.  In some instances, dosage form and/or strength may not be includedwhen space does not allow and if they are not essential in describing the drugproduct.</td></tr><tr><td>1.01</td><td>dea</td><td>1;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:No Control<br/>1:Research Only<br/>2:Most Abused<br/>3:Less Abused<br/>4:Potential Abuse<br/>5:Controlled<br/></td><td></td><td>The Drug Enforcement Administration Code denotes the degree of potential abuse and Federal control of a drug.

First DataBank will stop updating this NDC after a cutoff obsolete period agreed upon by the customer.  Typically, 3 years, so if an NDC contained an obsolete value of 890101, January 1, 1989, then on any update or full file tape created on or after January 1, 1992 (3 years after 890101), the NDC would no longer be sent.  Customers need to know that the NDC is no longer being supported on their update tapes, so the customer system can either anticipate when the NDC will no longer be sent, based on the cutoff date they provide to First DataBank, or by receiving a full file replacement formulary on some regularly scheduled basis, or through ad hoc requests.This field is can be used in conjunction with the Previous National Drug Code(PNDC) and the Replacement National Drug Code (REPNDC).</td></tr><tr><td>2.02</td><td>daddct</td><td>2;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date/time on which an NDC was added to the NDDF* Master file.*NDDF is a Trade Mark of the Hearst Corporation</td></tr><tr><td>2.03</td><td>daccesct</td><td>2;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date/time on which an NDC may be accessed on the NDDF* Master file.*NDDF is a Trade Mark of the Hearst Corporation</td></tr><tr><td>2.04</td><td>pndc</td><td>2;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8252.html">8252</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains the National Drug Code that was previously used for this product.
