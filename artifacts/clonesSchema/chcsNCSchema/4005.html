Thepresence of a value in this field will cause and entry in the UIF withthis destination to be packaged into a Mail message and sent to thisrecipient.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>retry rate</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the amount of time between attempts to process entries.  Onlyentries with the PENDING status will be retried.  This value will be usedif the corresponding value in the Transaction Type (if present) is null.Enter a number of hours (nnH), number of minutes (nnM), or number ofdays (nnD).</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>max number of attempts</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This indicates the maximum number of times that transactions for thisdestination will be requeued.

If no priorities are assigned to any destinations,or if all have the same priority then they will be processed in theorder received.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>use sequence no. protocol</td><td>0;9</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:No<br/>1:Yes<br/></td><td></td><td>This will signal the GIS that a sequence number should be assigned tooutbound messages, and that sequence numbers should be checked forinbound messages.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>acceptance tt</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4000.html">4000</a></td><td></td><td>This points to the transaction type which will be used to generatethe acceptance acknowledge message for this destination.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>accept ack conditions</td><td>0;11</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>AL:ALWAYS<br/>NE:NEVER<br/>SU:SUCCESS ONLY<br/>ER:ERROR ONLY<br/></td><td></td><td>This field specifies the conditions under which an accept (alsocalled commit) acknowledgement message will be created andreturned to the remote system. This field is a set of codes whichcoincides with the HL7 specified values for acknowledgement. Itover-rides the value contained in MSH-15.  If left blank, thevalue contained in MSH-15 will control the acknowledgementconditions.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>delivery queue</td><td>0;12</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:INLHSCH<br/>1:INLHDEST<br/></td><td></td><td>Indicates the queue to which outbound messages should be delivered.    0 - INLHSCH (default)  Output Controller queue 1 - INLHDEST           Destination queue (direct delivery).                        This is the queue for destinations                        with dedicated transmitter processes.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>device for output multiple</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4005_01.html">4005.01</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple holds the device to open prior to running the Transceiver routine given.  If more than one device is present, the system will gothrough the list until one is successful.  If no devices are given, thennone will be opened when the Transceiver routine is started.If any devices are given, the Transceiver routine will not start untila device is successfully opened.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>code to edit message</td><td>ED;E1,250</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field is Xecutable MUMPS code which if present will be used whenevera transaction with this destination is being edited using the TransactionEdit option.When this code is invoked, Y will hold the transaction entry # (file 4001)which is to be edited.  It will be assumed that an edit was done, but ifthe variable DWFILE is killed, then that will indicate that no edit occuredand the message will not be labelled as manually edited.</td></tr><tr><td>3.01</td><td>last sequence number</td><td>3;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the last sequence number transmitted or receivedto/from this destination.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>ip address</td><td>5;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4005_02.html">4005.02</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple contains the IP address(es) that the transceiver is to connect to transmit messages to the local system.  The addressescan be in the form "192.121.12.1" or "TND.OSD.MIL".  Determinationof the IP address(es) must be determined in coordination with theremote system manager.

This is the pointer from thesub-destination to the primary destination.  It is used when there aremultiple instantiations of a remote system.  The primary destination entryrepresents the first instantiation of a remote system and the associatedreplicant Transaction Type points to the primary destination.  Thesub-destination entries represent additional instantiations of a remotesystem and each points back to the primary destination.  This set ofstructures provides backward compatibility prior to support of multipleinstantiations of remote systems.</td></tr><tr><td>7.03</td><td>dmis id</td><td>7;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8103.html">8103</a></td><td></td><td>This is the DMIS ID associated with this destination.  </td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>route id</td><td>9;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="4005_04.html">4005.04</a></td><td></td><td>This is the Route ID(s) assigned to this destination.
