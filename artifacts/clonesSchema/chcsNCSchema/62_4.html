ASTRA-A, ASTRA-B)</td></tr><tr><td>.015</td><td>instrument name(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_7.html">62.7</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of the instrument as given by the manufacturer.This field points to the INSTRUMENT INTERFACE PARAMETERS file.  Thisfile is populated by SAIC with the names of the instruments as assignedby the manufactures.  Check your operating manual for the actualname of the instrument.</td></tr><tr><td>.018</td><td>dii instrument name</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8736.html">8736</a></td><td>AD</td><td>Name of the instrument as provided by Data Innovations.  This name mustmatch exactly with the name of the instrument that DII uses in theirsoftware.  It is NOT the name the site uses for the instrument.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>lsi</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_6.html">62.6</a></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the LSI  this instrument is connectedto.  This is a pointer to the LABORATORY SYSTEM INTERFACE file.When the instruments are interfaced the LSI devices will be named inthe LABORATORY SYSTEM INTERFACE file.  Each instrument is assigned to one LSI.  </td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>lsi port</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This defines the port on the LSI for this instrument.The Auto Instrument Trouble Shooting Guide describes the portlayout of the LSI.  The LSI port should be labeled when the LSIis set up during the lab implementation.   This field is cross referenced to the LSI Port field in the LAB SYSTEMINTERFACE file.  </td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>sample id format(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8733.html">8733</a></td><td></td><td>This field specifies the Sample ID format for use with this Auto Instrument.Selections will include format(s) that can be used by the Auto Instrument andcontain sufficient specimen info to create an exact match with an openaccession number. Using the Sample ID format entry, an accession can becreated that can be used to validate the Sample ID received with test resultsfrom the Auto Instrument. The ACCESSION NUMBER and WORK DOCUMENT ENTRYselections require an entry in the Work Document field and can be used ifAUTOMATIC DOWNLOAD is not selected in the Communications Mode field. </td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>work document</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="68_2.html">68.2</a></td><td></td><td>This is a pointer to the WORK DOCUMENT file.  It is the name of the workdocument associated with this instrument.  The work document does nothave to be generated in order to run the auto instrument on-line. The work document does have to be created in the work document file.The name of that work document is entered here. The system uses the work document entered here when the TAR option isrun. The system generates the work document during TAR if one has notbeen generated before the instrument was run.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>lab work element(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="69_92.html">69.92</a></td><td></td><td>Enter the name of the Lab Work Element in which this instrument is located.This will be used to screen the instrument list in Auto  Instrument resultentry options. Users will be able to select instruments that are located intheir Lab Work Element only.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>allow immediate certif.</td><td>0;8</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter yes into this field if the system should prompt for certification of the results during TAR.  The user who is signed onto TAR must still review the results and entera "Yes" to certify.  If a timeout occurs and the user does not certifythe result then the results are filed and the next accession appears. Immediate certification is useful for those results that are unlikely to be changed or added to after they are reviewed.  In addition,certification in TAR may be useful for instruments that transfer resultsslowly enough so that the lab user can review the results and certify beforethe next set of results are transmitted.  Instruments that transmit the results in a batch or delayed after the instrument has been runningfor awhile will probably not be best suited for immediate certificiation.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>match accessions</td><td>0;9</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Indicate in this field if the system should prompt the user to entermatch accessions.  The user is prompted to enter the instrument IDfollowed by a prompt to enter the accession # of the sample.  This fieldallows the users to match the instrument ID to the accession numberwithout having to run the instrument by work document. This function will be useful for older instruments that do not have thecapability to define accession numbers on the instrument.  Forinstruments that are not pre-programmed, this field allows users tomatch the instrument ID to the accession number without havingto run the instrument by work document.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>skip accession entries</td><td>0;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Specify whether users will be allowed to skip work document entriesFor example:If a work document has been generated for 10 samples, but when it is timeto run the test, the samples for two entries have not yet arrived.If this field has been set to yes, then the user can indicate the 2 entriesthe auto instrument program should skip. </td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>pause after each sample</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>When set to "Yes", output during the "Transfer Auto Instrument Results" (TAR) option will require the user to press <Return> after each sampleis filed.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td>pause after error message</td><td>0;12</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates whether or not output will be paused whenan error message is received from the instrument during the "Transfer Auto Instrument Results" (TAR) option.  The user must pressreturn after each error message is displayed.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>manufacturer(+)</td><td>0;14</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the name of the manufacturer of the auto instrument.</td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>model(+)</td><td>0;15</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the model of the auto instrument.</td></tr><tr><td>.16</td><td>serial number(+)</td><td>0;16</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the serial number of the auto instrument.</td></tr><tr><td>.17</td><td>auto validate</td><td>0;17</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>When this prompt is set to "YES", any results sent from the auto-analyzerwill be made available for auto-validation. If there is no Rule Set assignedto the Lab Test/Lab Method, the analyzer instrument test result will not beauto-certified and will be made available to be acted upon in the TransferAuto Instrument Results (TAR) option.    When this prompt is set to "NO", any results sent from the auto-analyzer willnot be eligible for auto-validation and will be made available to be actedupon in the Transfer Auto Instrument Results (TAR) option.</td></tr><tr><td>5.01</td><td>communications mode</td><td>5;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:UNIDIRECTIONAL<br/>1:BIDIRECTIONAL<br/>2:BIDIRECTIONAL QUERY<br/>3:AUTOMATIC DOWNLOAD<br/></td><td></td><td>COMMUNICATIONS MODEThis field determines if the instrument is to be run in unidirectional,bidirectional, or bidirectional query mode.Unidirectional mode indicates that the instrument can only transmit resultsto CHCS.Bidirectional mode indicates that CHCS can transmit a batch of test orderinformation to the instrument and the instrument transmits results to CHCS.Bidirectional query mode indicates that CHCS can only transmit test orderinformation when queried by the instrument and the instrument transmitsresults to CHCS.Automatic Download mode indicates that CHCS will automatically download a laborder message to the instrument upon completion of the accessioning process. When this selection is made, an Accession Area must be entered in theAuto Instrument file.          </td></tr><tr><td>5.02</td><td>tests to download</td><td>5;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>P:PANEL TESTS<br/>S:SINGLE TESTS<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter the code letter P or S to specify that PANEL or SINGLE tests shouldbe downloaded to this instrument.
