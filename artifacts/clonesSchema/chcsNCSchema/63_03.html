This is to allow test results andLOINC codes to be assigned that may not be in the LOINC codes file. A LOINCcode which is not in CHCS may be captured from an off-board system via anHL-7 message when the off-board system is using a different version of theLOINC tables. Data in this field should not be modified by the user and is generallyhidden from most data entry mechanisms.</td></tr><tr><td>.24</td><td>origin of result</td><td>0;24</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:PERFORMING LABORATORY<br/>2:COPATH<br/>3:DBSS<br/>4:OFFBOARD<br/></td><td></td><td>When this field is populated, it indicates that the accession was resultedby an outside laboratory or non-CHCS system.
