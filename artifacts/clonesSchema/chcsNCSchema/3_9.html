Messages are numbered sequentially,and numbers are never re-used.  Numbers appear in the "Query" listing forthe message, as <number>@<domain name>, where <number> is the messagenumber for this message, and <domain name> is the name of the domain,as defined in the kernel site parameter file.  This combination ofnumber and domain name uniquely identifies ALL messages in the mailmannetwork, and editing control is such that no two copies of the messageat different domains are different; the message is either identicalor missing.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>subject(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the subject of the message, which is displayed whenever the messageis shown to users.  If the message happens to be a local reply, the messagesubject will not be cross-referenced. This text contains ~U~ if the subject contains an up-arrow.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>from(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the sender of the message stored as free text.  The  user number is not used to speed resolution.   In the case of a networked message, the user's full network address,in the ARPA net name format <user@domain>, is stored in the SMTP FROM and SMTP FROM CONT fields (numbered 7.01 and 7.1, respectively), to allowfor up to 264 characters of storage.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>sender</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the message is sent by a surrogate, this field holds the surrogate'sidentity. It is displayed on the message header in parentheses, with the textSENDER: preceding the sender's name.</td></tr><tr><td>1.13</td><td>user pointer(+)</td><td>0;13</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td></td><td>This is the user that actually sent the message.  This may be usedto resolve ambiguities in the name stored in the FROM field (#1).</td></tr><tr><td>1.14</td><td>sender pointer</td><td>0;14</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td></td><td>This is the sender's IEN in the user file.</td></tr><tr><td>1.15</td><td>type</td><td>0;15</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:local<br/>1:network<br/>2:relay<br/></td><td></td><td>For Network MailMan, this field indicates the type of message. The following codes can be selected for the field:     0 : local   -- the Sender (From) is a local user    1 : network -- the Sender (From) is a remote user    2 : relay   -- the message is stored temporarily before relaying to                   next relay point (which may or may not be the final                   destination) For a relay message, once the message is transmitted through the SMTPTransmission Queue, the local message is marked for deletion.</td></tr><tr><td>1.3</td><td>confirmation requested?</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>y:YES<br/>n:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This specifies whether or not the sender of a message will get anacknowledgement when the message is read by the recipient.</td></tr><tr><td>1.35</td><td>expiration date</td><td>0;8</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>The automatic purge routine will delete messages whose expiration date haspassed even if they are located in someone's basket (they will also beremoved from the baskets).  If this field is null then the message has noexpiration date.</td></tr><tr><td>1.4</td><td>date entered</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the date and time at which this message was sent.  It relatesto the completion of the sending process, not the beginning, as previousversions did.</td></tr><tr><td>1.6</td><td>smtp rcpt</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:local recipients only<br/>1:network and/or local recipients<br/>2:relay message<br/></td><td></td><td>For Network MailMan, this field is a set of codes indicating what typeof users are recipients on the mail message. The following codes can be  selected for the field:          0 = local recipients only         1 = network recipients(s) and/or mailgroup(s)         2 = this is a Relay message (we are simply a relay point);             there are no recipients stored in the MESSAGE File If the selected code is 1, then local users may or may not be recipients. Network Mail Groups are 'expanded' when the message is received at theremote site. If the selected code is 2, then the message is marked for deletion oncethe message is sent to the next relay point (which may or may not be thefinal destination). The RCPT TO: (recipient) information is stored inthe SMTP Transmission Queue.</td></tr><tr><td>1.7</td><td>parent message</td><td>0;7</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>If this message is a reply, this field contains its parent message.</td></tr><tr><td>1.8</td><td>scramble hint</td><td>0;10</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is a short hint to be displayed to the receiver when he sees themessage when it is scrambled.</td></tr><tr><td>1.85</td><td>scramble key</td><td>K;E1,30</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the referenced message is scrambled, this field contains the keyto unscramble it. To see a scrambled message, the reader must enterthe text corresponding to this key exactly. The key is stored in scrambled form.  A first character of 1 indicatesthat scrambling is done in standard bazaries cylinder form.  Otherfirst characters are reserved.</td></tr><tr><td>1.95</td><td>closed message?</td><td>0;9</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>y:YES<br/>n:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field, if set to "yes", means that recipients may not forward orcopy the message.  </td></tr><tr><td>1.96</td><td>confidential?</td><td>0;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>y:YES<br/>n:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field, if set to "yes", means that surrogates of the recipientsmay not read this message.</td></tr><tr><td>1.97</td><td>information only?</td><td>0;12</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>y:YES<br/>n:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field, if set to "YES", will cause all recipients to be considered"INFORMATION ONLY", which disables responses to the message.  If a sender wishes to individually restrict responses, "INFO:" beforethe recipient's names will restrict their responses. Messages which are broadcast (by naming a recipient "*"), are automaticallyset to INFORMATION ONLY.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>recipient</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="3_91.html">3.91</a></td><td></td><td>This is a list of all recipients of this message.  MailMan automaticallytracks each recipient's progress through the response chain, whenthey last read it, who forwarded or copied the message, etc.  This information is displayed with the Query option after reading the message.</td></tr><tr><td>2.1</td><td>addressee</td><td>6;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="3_911.html">3.911</a></td><td></td><td>This field contains a list of addressees only when that list contains alocal mail group.  If present, it is the address list used whentransmitting a message across the network.  This is to prevent sendingthe entire expanded listing of a mail group out with the message.Replies will then come back addressed to the mail group and then be expandedon the local system.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>text</td><td>2;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the actual text of the message.  It is stored without thewrap-around logic, in a line-by-line format.</td></tr><tr><td>7.01</td><td>smtp from</td><td>7;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the message is of TYPE=1 (network), then this field indicates the network sender of the message stored as free text. In this case, it isthe user's full network address, in the ARPA net name format user@domain. If the message is of TYPE=2 (relay), then this field indicates the relay sender of the message stored as free text.  In this case, it is the user's  full network address, including relay information, in the %hack format user%domain%relay2@relay1.</td></tr><tr><td>7.1</td><td>smtp from cont</td><td>7.1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the message is of TYPE=2 (relay), then the data for the SMTP FROM field  has the potential of containing more than 250 characters which is themaximum storage capacity of the field. In this case, the data in excessof 250 characters is stored in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>response</td><td>3;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="3_9001.html">3.9001</a></td><td></td><td>This is a list of the responses to the message.  Each response isa separate message, with a subject of "R" followed by this responsenumber.</td></tr><tr><td>8.01</td><td>smtp sender</td><td>8;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If message is of TYPE=1 (network), then this is the person who sent the network message, if not the same as SMTP FROM.  If the network message is sent by a surrogate, this field holds the surrogate's identity.   Also, if the message is of TYPE=2 (relay), then this is the personwho sent the relay message, if not the same as SMTP FROM.It is the user's full network address, including relay informationin %hack format: user%domain%relay2@relay1</td></tr><tr><td>8.1</td><td>smtp sender cont</td><td>8.1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the message is of TYPE=2 (relay), then the data for the SMTP SENDERfield has the potential to contain more than 250 characters which isthe maximum capacity of the field. In this case, the data in excess of250 characters is stored in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>incoming message id</td><td>5;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>I</td><td>This is an index to incoming messages from remote nodes on the network.The Message ID of the remote message, as contained in the message headeris stored here. This index is used to retrieve remote messages which have been transmittedfrom other domains.  For example, if message 123 from loma-linda hasbeen sent to another site, that other site could inquire against message ID "123@loma-linda", to find out if the message had been received yet. This index is also used to prevent messages from looping around thenetwork.  The MailMan receiver will not allow the same message to bereceived twice at the same site.</td></tr><tr><td>9.01</td><td>smtp header</td><td>9;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td>For Network MailMan, this word processing field will store the SMTP header information. The SMTP header structure is compliant with the required definitions andformat described in Internet RFC #822.  The header is displayed when thelocal user performs a "Query" at the message action prompt.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>No REFERENCES reply available to process</p></div>
