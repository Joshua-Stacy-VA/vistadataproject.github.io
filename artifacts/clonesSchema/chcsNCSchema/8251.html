Every NDCTBL record (National Drug Code) contains a GCN Seq No, which allows the association of allNDC products with an identical combination of ingredients, dosage form, route of administration and strength.First DataBank has developed a complement of fields termed Smart Key (SKEY).  The SKEY leverages existing NDDF* data along with two codified fields resulting in a a unique field consisting of seven independent codes.  These numeric subfields in a 24 numeric digit field are assigned to each NDC.  CHCSuses these fields as pointers to First DataBank STRENGTHTBL (SKEY_STR), DOSETBL (SKEY_DOSE) and ROUTETBL (SKEY_RT).  The Breakdown of the 24 numeric field is as follows:Byte to Byte          Description       . MNEMONIC    # of digits 1   -     2  Generic Therapeutic Class . SKEY_GTC           2 3   -     6  Specific Therapeutic Class. SKEY_STC           4 7   -    11  Generic Name              . SKEY_HICL          5                  12   -    15  Drug Strength             . SKEY_STR           4                  16   -    18  Dosage Form               . SKEY_DOSE          3                  19   -    20  Route of Administration   . SKEY_RT            2                  21   -    23  Package Size              .

The HICL Sequence Number can be combined with the specific therapeutic class, route code, dosage form code and/or strength description for specialized DUR reporting applications.The HICL*SEQNO is at the GCN*SEQNO table. An associated table, containing the HICL*SEQNO and HICL will be required for most applications.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>skey str</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8251_1.html">8251.1</a></td><td></td><td>The smart key strength code is a four digit number (with leading zeros removed) identifying all unique strength descriptions.  The unique feature of the SKEY_STR field is that a unique SKEY_STR value identifies the same strength regardless of any other SKEY component.  This means a SKEY_STR value of 15, identifying 0.05mg, is the same for all SKEYS.  SKEY_STR values are assigned onthe basis of strength units, and this group assignment allows for an assignmentof SKEY_STR values as relative numbers.  For instance, the range of SKEY_STR values, 1 through 999 represent milligrams, so a value of 5 is less than 500, the 5 being 0.02mg, and the 550 being 130 mg.  Percents are assigned relative numbers in the range 1000 through 2000, so a SKEY_STR value of 1000 is less than a SKEY_STR value of 1100.  A value of 150 compared to 1000 would have no meaning, since we would be comparing a milligram to a percent.  This relative ranking of numbers means that a selection of all strengths between 15mg and 100mg is possible by simply specifying the SKEY_STR range of 270-475 (270 is 15mg, and 475 is 100mg).If a SKEY_STR for an NDC is assigned zero, CHCS will assign it a valuestarting with 10000.  All NDCs using the same 10 character strength description will point to the same value.  As First DataBank assigns a SKEY_STR to that strength description CHCS will change SKEY_STR to reflect theassignment.  The range and meaning of First DataBanks SKEY_STR is as follows:    1 -  999 Mg 1000 - 2000 Percent 3000 - 3205 UnitsStrength displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC,  The 10 characterstrength (STR) found in the STRENGTHTBL is the fourth space delimited parameterto display.  The NDC ID is formatted as NNNNN-NNNN-NN GNN (BN) STR RT GCDF.The SKEY_STR on CHCS is a pointer to 8251.1 (STRENGTHTBL).</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>skey dose</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8251_2.html">8251.2</a></td><td></td><td>The smart key dosage code is a three digit number (with leading zeros removed) representing the nearly 200 different dosage forms.  Like all Smart Key components, the SKEY_DOSE values are the same across all other SKEY components.The SKEY_DOSE is compatible with NDDF* current dosage form code (GCDF), forming a one to one relationship, and providing downward support for existing applications.  SKEY_DOSE can be used for selecting dosage forms reqardless of strength, it can be used for sorting products into unique dosage form groups, or for encoding drug formularies.  The SKEY_DOSE has the added benefit in the selected ranges of values are reserved for common dosage forms.  The common dosage form types using special ranges are aerosol's, capsules, and tablets.  Aerosols use the range values 400-499, capsules 500-599, and tablets, 600-699.These ranges are very selective, however, certain applications may require the specification of all capsules, or all tablets, or all aerosols, and these special SKEY_DOSE ranges provide this support.  If a SKEY_DOSE for an NDC is assigned zero, CHCS will assign it a numeric value by concatenating each ascii character of the GCDF field as its Numeric equivalent $A().  All NDCs using the same 2 character dosage form description will point to the samevalue.  As First DataBank assigns a SKEY_DOSE to that dosage description CHCS will change SKEY_DOSE to reflect the assignment. Drug Dosage displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.  The 10 characterdosage (Dose) found in the DOSETBL is the sixth space delimited parameterto display.  The NDC ID is formatted as NNNNN-NNNN-NN GNN (BN) STR RT GCDF.The SKEY_DOSE on CHCS is a pointer to 8251.2 (DOSETBL).*NDDF is a Trade Mark of the Hearst Corporation.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>skey rt</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8251_3.html">8251.3</a></td><td></td><td>The smart key Route Code is a two digit number (with leading zeros removed) representing the route of administration.  An SKEY_RT code value is interpretedthe same for all SKEY subfields.  The SKEY_RT  is compatible with NDDF* one character (GCRT) and two character route (GCRT2), forming a one to onerelationship with each.  The compatibility provides both downward and upwardcompatibility with existing NDDF* data.  The SKEY_RT  allows the selection ofroute specific products with or without other SKEY subfield definitions, providing easy searches and easy formulary definitions.If a SKEY_RT for an NDC is assigned zero, CHCS will assign it a numeric value by concatenating each ascii character of the GCRT field as its Numeric equivalent $A().  All NDCs using the same 2 character route description will point to the same value.  As First DataBank assigns a SKEY_RT to that routedescription CHCS will change SKEY_RT to reflect the assignment. Route of Administration displays as part of the IDentifier of an NDC.

The selection of the included AHFS# is determined by consultation with the staff of the AHFS.Note A: Conventionally, an AHFS classification number is printed with a colonbetween the second and third digits and a period between the fourth and fifthdigits  (e.g. 20:12.12).A leading zero is printed (e.g. 08:12.28 instead of 8:12.28). The fifth and sixth digits are generally omitted if zeros (e.g. 88:28). In NDDF* records, the colon and period are not included but all digits are carried, e.g. 8:04 becomes 08040 0 in NDDF*).Note B: The AHFS classification system is copyrighted by the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists and is used in NDDF* under a license agreement betweenAHFS and FDB.Note C: A default value of 999999 is used when a record has not been classifiedunder the AHFS system.The AHFS on CHCS is a pointer to 8251.4 (AHFSDESCTBL).*NDDF is a Trade Mark of the Hearst Corporation</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>hic3</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>AHIC3</td><td>The Hierarchical Ingredient Code Specific Therapeutic Class (HIC3) is the first three bytes of the Hierarchical Ingredient Code.
