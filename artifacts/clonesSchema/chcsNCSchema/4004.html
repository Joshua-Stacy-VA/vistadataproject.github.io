All other backgroundprocesses are defined by the developers of specific interfacesas needed. The most common developer defined background process is thereceiver.  This is typically used to receive data from a remotesystem.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>number</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the unique number identifying the background process.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the background process.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>active(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:INACTIVE<br/>1:ACTIVE<br/></td><td>ACT</td><td>This field indicates if this background process is active.

This is the number ofmessages (maximum) that can be sent to the destination system priorto attempting to receive any responses from that destination system.  This value can be set relatively low to provide interface manageabilityor high to provide potentially faster throughput.  Considerationshould be given to the TCP/IP buffer size in use on the source and destination systems when setting this value.
