Although it is structurally and functionally an independent system, it is officially part of HL7 1.6.  This is a messaging system similar to the old HL7 1.6 package, but it was designed from the ground up and is more robust, more capable, and supports a much higher message throughput.  This file is used create screens for reporting HLO messaging errors. A screenis a list of criteria used to either include or exclude specific error typesin an error report.  A screen is identified by its name.  The name should be namespaced and bedescriptive as to its intended use.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>screen name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name to identify the screen.

If the string matches a string that occurs within theerror, the error is either:INCLUDE type screens - the error will be included in the display.EXCLUDE type screens - the error will be excluded from the display.This is the verbatim text of the error to be screened. A list of possibleerrors is in the HLO Technical Manual. Alternately, you may cut and paste textfrom the error display into this field. You might screen errors for thefollowing purposes:1)  To exclude certain errors from the display.  Some of the errors don'trequire any action on your part.2)  To display only certain errors.   These are critical errors which you wantto act on quickly.  You KNOW from experience what those errors are. </td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
