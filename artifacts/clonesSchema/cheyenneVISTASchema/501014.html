With it you make entries into a personal calendar, place an item on a general to-do list, or have an entry be part of both.  A Calendar entry is entered for a given date and can optionally be given a time of day and duration.  Calendar features include:     Day, Week, and Month displays     Edit, View, List, and Print Calendar or To-Do entries     Six month planner display  Calendar also has an Index Card function for entry and retrieval of whatever information you wish to store. ;Summary of Functions  DAY DISPLAY      For the current day, or a day you select, a calendar, list of events,      and a time matrix for appointments with a duration entered. WEEK DISPLAY      Enter any date and a Sunday thru Saturday display is given showing a      time matrix for each day and entry keywords for each day of the week. MONTH DISPLAY      For the month you specify, a count of each entries per day. EDIT ENTRY      To enter or edit either a calendar or to-do list entry. VIEW      To view a single calendar/to-do entry or in 'loop' mode review all      entries in your file for possible edit or purging. LIST and PRINT      Provides an abbreviated screen display of your calendar/to-do entries      or allows a printed list of either. SIX MONTH PLANNER      A six month calendar display for planning purposes. INDEX CARD      A non-calendar area for general information storage. ;Miscellaneous Functions   SETUP      Provides user access to certain calendar parameters. ASSUME SURROGATE      Allows a user to change their calendar identity, if permitted. PURGE ENTRIES      Provides a quick way to clean and manage their calendar database.   Even though there are two menu lines, you can select most functions from either one.    There is additional on-line help available at both menu select prompts, accessible by entering  ?  or  ??  or  ???  at either menu line. ;Day Display     On entry into Calendar, you are given the 'Day' display for the current date. The display contains a monthly calendar for the day being viewed, a list of entries for the day, and a time matrix showing any time blocks marked out for appointments or whatever.  An entry in your calendar may be:      - something to be done or be remembered that day and thus not have any        time associated with it      - an event on that day at a specific time      - an event with a time and duration      - an entry for a date in the future which you've specified to be displayed        early      - an entry for the a date past which you've specified to be displayed        daily until changed or deleted   Enter two question marks  ??  at the main menu to see help text on various ways to specify the day you would like displayed. ;Sample Day Display   Calendar for  John Schmidt                             Today is  AUG 22,1989 =============================================================================       AUG 1989      || Memos for  TODAY!

When you add a new entry it is by default for your calendar unless you specify otherwise.  The following rules determine whether an entry is considered part of your calendar or to-do list:  a) An entry with a DATE FOR CALENDAR is for your calendar. b) An entry without a date is a to-do list item. c) If an entry has both a DATE FOR CALENDAR and a TO-DO LIST PRIORITY,    is a to-do item with a due date.  A priority for a to-do item is    usually optional unless the entry is also to appear on your calendar,    then it's required.  If you edit an existing entry, the above rules will determine the field order you will be prompted with. ;Entry Fields  DESCRIPTION      2-40 characters describing your calendar or to-do list entry. DATE FOR CALENDAR      Date of the event for your calendar.  You may optionally enter a time if      desired.  Question this prompt for a display of valid date and time      formats that you may enter.  If you enter a date without the year, future      is assumed.  See 'Enhanced DATE entry' screen for the various ways      a date can be entered. KEYWORD FOR WEEK DISPLAY      2-10 characters for the week display that will remind you of this memo.      The memo entry is cross-referenced by both keyword and description for      easier retrieval. LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT      If your memo date has a time, and you want to block out your time matrix      to show an appointment time and length then you may enter the length here      in minutes.  You may use the letter H to designate hours (90 minutes could      be entered 1.5H).  If an entry blocks the entire day (holiday, vacation      etc) you can enter an asterisk '*' to replace the time matrix with the      entry subject text. ;Entry Fields (continued)   ADVANCE DISPLAY WINDOW      A memo you enter will display on the day you specify for calendar date.      This field is to specify how many days, if any, in advance of that date      you want to start seeing the memo appear on your day display. ALWAYS DISPLAY AFTER DATE PASSES      This is good for reminders that should be displayed until taken care of,      even if you don't get to it on the day you initially set up for display.      You may have reports due on the first day of the month, but you need to be      reminded of them until completed, regardless of the day. NOTES      This is a FileMan word processing field for any additional notes you want      to enter. TO-DO LIST PRIORITY      If an entry is for your calendar only, then this field is left blank.      If you enter a priority then it will also appear on your to-do list.      Remember that if you are making a new entry, you will be prompted with      this field format. ;View/Edit Action   After you enter/edit an entry through EDIT or review an entry with VIEW you will see a 'Select View/Edit Action:  NONE//' prompt.  You may just return to accept the default of none, or you may select EDIT, DELETE, VIEW, PRINT, COPY, or LOOP.  Loop will step through all of your entries making it easier for you to review each for possible edit or deletion.  You should periodically purge your calendar of old entries.  You can go directly into (Looping) mode from the main menu by selecting EDIT or VIEW and then enter ^LOOP or ^L when asked to select an entry.  Copy will replicate an entry to additional date@times that you specify.  If you have a reoccuring meeting you would like to put in your calendar, you can make an entry for the first date and time and then copy it to additional dates without having to re-enter all of the information. ;Setup   The SETUP option provides access to:  1. Change the name displayed on headings.  By default Calendar will extract your name from the USER file, swap positions of the first and last name, and convert it to lower case.  The converted name is stored here for use in Calendar.  You may change it if you wish.  2. Allow MailMan surrogates to have access.  Calendar was designed for the VA software environment and may be placed as part of the general MailMan menu. This would allow surrogate users that you've specified for your mail to also have access to your calendar.  Depending on the environment this program is being used in, this option may not appear.  3. Select Calendar Surrogate allows you to designate another user or users the ability to view and maintain your calendar. ;Enhanced DATE entry format   Besides being able to answer prompts for dates in the usual FileMan formats, most of the calendar date prompts have been enhanced to accept other answers. Examples:  Entry of only the date of the month, like 23.  Current month is assumed except for the memo date field, where a day during the next 30 is assumed.  You may enter the day of week (minimum of first two letters), like MO or MONDAY.  This form assumes a date in the next 7 days.  You can use either of these with time, i.e. 23@0800 and/or MO@0800, or MONDAY@0800.  For the month display, you may enter just the month number, like 6 for June, or at least the first three letters of the name of the month, like JUN. The future is assumed, so if you want a past month, you must enter the year also.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>user name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="3.html">3</a></td><td>B</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>memo</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="501014_01.html">501014.01</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>last used calendar</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>name displayed(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>When a new calendar file is created for a user, it will use the namefrom the user file as default for the screen headers.
