If there is no activity on theconnection for this amount of time, the client will send a systemheartbeat message. The client, as part of the initial connection protocol, retrieves this value. As a result, the client and the M server are always synchronizedregarding the heartbeat rate.  See also: LATENCY DELTA</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>latency delta</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the number of seconds to add to the HEARTBEAT RATE when calculating the initial timeout value for the VistALink Listener. The client and the M server are synchronized regarding the HEARTBEAT RATE. This latency parameter allows the site to fine tune the timeoutvalue. The site can to take into account any network slowness or otherfactors that may delay the arrival of the system heartbeat message fromthe client. See also: HEARTBEAT RATE</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>j2ee connection timeout</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the number of seconds that a VistaLink connectionfrom J2EE to M should be allowed to remain connected but inactive, beforeM drops the connection. It is recommended that this J2EE CONNECTION TIMEOUTparameter be set relatively high, for example 1 day (86400 seconds). A high setting is recommended because all the major applicationserver implementations have more robust mechanisms for controllingconnection pools. The site should use the tools/mechanisms suppliedby the application server implementation to control how the connectionpool size grows and shrinks. For a quick indicator of the level of control available, below is abrief summary of the connection pool properties in the J2EEdeployment descriptors (DD) for J2EE Connector Architecture (J2CA)adaptors by the major application servers.  BEA WebLogic:============= DD  file: weblogic-ra.xmlDTD file: weblogic810-ra.dtd  <pool-params>    <initial-capacity>1</initial-capacity>    <max-capacity>5</max-capacity>    <capacity-increment>1</capacity-increment>    <shrinking-enabled>true</shrinking-enabled>    <connection-profiling-enabled>false</connection-profiling-enabled>    <shrink-frequency-seconds>900</shrink-frequency-seconds>    <inactive-connection-timeout-seconds>0         </inactive-connection-timeout-seconds>    <highest-num-waiters>2147483647</highest-num-waiters>    <highest-num-unavailable>0</highest-num-unavailable>    <connection-creation-retry-frequency-seconds>0         </connection-creation-retry-frequency-seconds>    <connection-reserve-timeout-seconds>10         </connection-reserve-timeout-seconds>    <test-frequency-seconds>0</test-frequency-seconds>    <match-connections-supported>true</match-connections-supported>  </pool-params>  Oracle 9iAS:============ DD  file: oc4j-ra.xmlDTD file: oc4j-connector-factories.dtd  <connection-pooling>    <property name="waitTimeout" value="0" />    <property name="scheme" value="fixed" />    <property name="maxConnections" value="5" />    <property name="minConnections" value="1" /> </connection-pooling>  JBoss:====== DD  file: jboss-xxx-ds.xmlDTD file: ??  <min-pool-size>1</min-pool-size> <max-pool-size>5</max-pool-size> <blocking-timeout-millis>5000</blocking-timeout-millis> <idle-timeout-minutes>15</idle-timeout-minutes>  For more information on each application server implementation, seedocumentation for each individual implementation.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>j2ee reauthentication timeout</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Number of seconds a connection is considered reauthenicated after a successful reauthentication has occurred. Rules Enforced:===============- If a connection in the application server's pool is not  reused by the reauthenticated user before this timeout  limit is reached, the reauthentication is considered expired. - If expiration does occur, the re-authentication process is  performed again. - If expiration does not occur, the session is considered  reauthenticated for these number of seconds. (i.e. the time  out clock is reset) - If a different user gains access to the connection, the  connection is immediately considered not reauthenticated and  the reauthentication process is performed. Example of Reauthentication Expiration:======================================= - User gains access and uses a connection from the pool at 4:00pm - User signs off and goes home, along with most of the site staff - After 4:00pm, user file maintenance is performed and    the user's profile is changed. For example, the user's    FILE MANAGER ACCESS CODE [DUZ(0)] is changed.   - User signs back on the next morning at 8am - Since there is very little activity from 4:00-8am, the connection   has not been re-used by another user and is still associated with    4:00 user - Since timeout has passed, reauthentication has expired - Reauthentication process occurs for user - Reauthentication process re-sets DUZ(0) appropriately to new value. </td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>default http timeout</td><td>2;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field indicates the default HTTP time-out (in seconds) for call outof the M to a J2EE application server using the M2J feature in VistALink. This time-out value can be overridden by specifying a time-out for anparticular application server. This is accomplished by entering a time-outvalue for DEFAULT HTTP TIMEOUT (#.1) field in the VISTALINK J2EE APP SERVERS (#18.08) file.  Note: This field is only used by the VistALink v2.0 codebase.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>listener configuration</td><td>CONFIG;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="18_012.html">18.012</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple field contains the VistALink Listener configurations for BOX-VOLUME entries in the DOMAIN NAME's scope. Each configuration is used by the XOBV LISTENER STARTUP menu option. Thisoption is typically scheduled to run as part of the system startup afterthe VistA system has been restarted. The option will start up VistALinkListeners for the BOX-VOLUME where Task Manager is running. Note: This only applies to Cache NT systems. VMS/DSM systems need to use the TCP/IP (UCX) utility to have Listeners automatically startedon reboot.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
