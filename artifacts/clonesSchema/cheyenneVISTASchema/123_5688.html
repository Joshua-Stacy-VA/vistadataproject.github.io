However,if the stopcode of the REQUEST SERVICE is different than the stop code ofthe clinic into which the procedure is scheduled, it would be necessary toput both stopcodes into the REQUEST SERVICE to allow both consults andprocedure requests to display for scheduling clerks. The stop code of the chosen clinic during the scheduling process is compared to the stop codes of any consult which could be linked to theappointment.  If there is a match, and the current status of the consultmeets the criteria listed below, the clerk will be presented with thefollowing query:                "Will this appointment be for a CONSULT/ PROCEDURE? NO//"This query allows the scheduling clerk to first display, and then link, the appointment to the consult.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><div class='error'><p>Error: Invalid Global File Type: 123.5688</p></div></div>
