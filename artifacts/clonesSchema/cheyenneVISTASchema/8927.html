All shared andpersonal templates, as well as template hierarchy, are stored withinthis file. Duplicate template names are allowed, usually distinguished by personalowner. This file is intended for the CPRS GUI only.  No server sideimplementation is provided or feasible.  Maintenance of this fileshould only be performed using the Template Editor, which is containedwithin the CPRS GUI.  Bypassing the template editor can cause filestructure problems.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the name of the template as it will appear in the template tree,3-60 characters in length, not starting with punctuation. Duplicate NAMEs ARE permitted, and are distinguished by the tree theybelong to.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>blank lines</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the number of blank lines inserted between Group Template itemswhen the template is used for composing documents. For example, suppose a Group Template DEMOGRAPHICS has item templates NAMEand ADDRESS, each with boilerplate as shown:        Template        Boilerplate       -------------------------------       NAME            Patient Name:       ADDRESS         Street Address:                       City:                       State, Zip: Then the boilerplate for a document entered using template DEMOGRAPHICSwith BLANK LINES = 1 would look like:   Patient Name:                    << 1 blank line  Street Address:  City:  State, Zip: BLANK LINES can have values from 0 to 3.  BLANK LINES applies only toGROUP TEMPLATES.  The default value for BLANK LINES is 0.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>type(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>T:TEMPLATE<br/>G:GROUP TEMPLATE<br/>C:CLASS CONTAINER<br/>P:PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER<br/>R:SHARED ROOT CONTAINER<br/>TF:TITLE ROOT FOLDER<br/>CF:CONSULT ROOT FOLDER<br/>OF:PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER<br/></td><td></td><td>The TIU TEMPLATE FILE stores templates for use in composing documents andalso stores the containers which organize the templates into trees. Everyentry in the file belongs to at least one tree.  Some entries containother entries as items. There are 5 types of entries in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE:      'T' for TEMPLATE      'G' for GROUP TEMPLATE      'C' for CONTAINER      'P' for PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER      'R' for SHARED ROOT CONTAINER      'TF' for TITLE ROOT FOLDER      'CF' for CONSULT ROOT FOLDER      'OF' for PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER The first two types, T and G, are true templates and may be selectedfor composing documents. The remaining types are "containers" which hold templates as items.The purpose of the container types is to organize templates accordingto subject matter into trees, so that individual templates can be easilyfound as "leaves" of a tree.  Container types are NOT used forcomposing documents. Besides holding templates, containers may hold other containers, whichthen function as subcontainers. The last five types, P, R, TF, CF, and OF, are containers of a specialtype, denoted "roots".  A root functions as the single top level of itstree.  Each site has a "shared" root container, which contains templatesshared across the whole facility.  Each user at a site has a "personal"root container, which contains the user's personal templates.  Thus, eachuser at a site has access to two trees: the shared tree, and their ownpersonal tree.  The Title, Consult and Procedure root folders are special folders that allow templates to be linked to specific TIU Titles, ConsultReasons for Request, and Procedure Reasons for Request. Root containers (like all container types) hold templates of type T and G,and may also hold subcontainers (type C).                              TYPE DETAILS  'T': A TEMPLATE is the most basic piece of boilerplate text desired.  Itmay be used by itself for composing documents, or it may be added as anitem to a Group Template, becoming part of a larger template.  'G': A GROUP TEMPLATE  is a composite of its item TEMPLATES.  In additionto the boilerplate text of its items, it may also have its own boilerplatetext. A GROUP TEMPLATE may also have items of type CONTAINER (C).  Theseitems are for storage only; they are ignored when the GROUP TEMPLATE isused to compose a document.  'C': A CLASS CONTAINER is a container for templates. In addition totemplates, it may also contain other containers (C), which then functionas subcontainers.  'P': A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER functions as the root (top level) of auser's personal template tree. A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER may contain bothshared and personal entries. When adding shared entries to their personal trees, users need to be awarethat changes made at the facility level to a shared template will carryover to their personal tree. Changes a user makes to a shared entry intheir personal tree do NOT, however, carry over to the shared tree.Instead, when a user goes to edit a shared item under his/her PERSONALROOT CONTAINER, that item is copied, and the user made the PERSONAL OWNERof the copy. The original shared item remains the same in the shared tree.  'R': A SHARED ROOT CONTAINER is shared across a site.  Templatescontained in it may be selected by any user composing a document, but theuser may not edit the template itself. Besides its use for documents, asite's shared tree functions as a repository from which users can addtemplates to their own personal tree.  'TF': The TITLE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific TIU Titles.  Although end users will not see this folder directly, they will seetemplates appear automatically when the associated TIU Title is selected.  'CF': The CONSULT ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Consult Reasonsfor Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, but they willsee templates appear automatically when ordering a consult, and theassociated Consult service is selected.  'OF': The PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Procedure Reasons for Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, butthey will see templates appear automatically when ordering a procedure,and the associated procedure is selected.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>status</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>A:ACTIVE<br/>I:INACTIVE<br/></td><td></td><td>Entries in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE have status ACTIVE or INACTIVE. StatusINACTIVE serves as a way to hide entries from users composing documents. INACTIVE templates are NOT available for composing documents. In theory,ACTIVE templates ARE available.  In fact, however, even an ACTIVEtemplate's select ability depends on its position in the tree, as will beseen below. Containers, for their part, may also have status ACTIVE or INACTIVE, andmay contain ACTIVE or INACTIVE items.  Thus, an INACTIVE container maycontain ACTIVE templates.  However, an INACTIVE container and all itsitems (whatever status) are hidden from the user composing documents andare thus not selectable. Although users are permitted to have more than one Personal RootContainer, only one per user is allowed to be ACTIVE at a given time.Similarly, a site can have only one ACTIVE Shared Root Container at agiven time. If an entry is no longer desired for either storage or for composingdocuments, it can be deleted.  However, once the last occurrence of it asan item in any tree is deleted, it is deleted from the file itself andcannot be retrieved.  Therefore, users are encouraged to INACTIVATEentries rather than delete them unless they are sure they won't want themback in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>exclude from group boilerplate</td><td>0;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Applies only to templates (types T and G). There are occasions when atemplate is added as an item to some Group Template simply as a logicalstorage place, and not because the template is usually desired as part ofthe composite boilerplate text of the Group Template. This field permits the user to specify that a particular template beignored whenever it is an item of a Group Template being used to compose adocument. The field applies to both shared and personal templates.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>personal owner</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td>PO</td><td>The PERSONAL OWNER of an entry is a user from the NEW PERSON FILE who canedit the template or container.  An entry is recognized by the computer aspersonal (as opposed to shared) by the presence of a PERSONAL OWNER.PERSONAL OWNER is set automatically when a user goes to edit a sharedentry in their personal tree: the shared entry is copied, and the user ismade the owner of the copy.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>editor class</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8930.html">8930</a></td><td></td><td>EDITOR CLASS applies ONLY to shared root containers, active or inactive.The EDITOR CLASS is a class from the USR CLASS FILE whose members can editall containers and templates in the shared template tree.

It may also hold other containers as items. A GROUP TEMPLATE is made up of TEMPLATES or of other GROUP TEMPLATES asitems.  Its boilerplate text is a composite consisting of, first, it ownboilerplate text if it has any, and then the boilerplate text of itsitems, in SEQUENCE order.  (See also field EXCLUDE FROM GROUPBOILERPLATE.)  A GROUP TEMPLATE may also have a container (type C) as anitem.  In this case, the container is simply being stored in the GROUPTEMPLATE; the container is ignored when the GROUP TEMPLATE is used forcomposing a document. A TEMPLATE (type T) does not have items. A given template or container may occur as an item in more than one tree,and may even occur more than once in the same tree.  It cannot, however,be an item under itself.  Nor can it occur twice, as an item of the sameparent. An item may be deleted (after a warning) from a tree by its Personal Owner(for personal trees) or by a member of the Editor Class (for sharedtrees).  If this instance is the only remaining occurrence of the entry inany tree, it is then deleted not only as an item, but also as an entry inthe TIU TEMPLATE FILE and cannot be retrieved.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
