Backdoor orders send a notification for electronicsignature and require a signature, unless the order has a Nature of Order set to null.3>Yes (Allow S.O.C. & Written)  Is the same as option 2 except that itwill allow orders sent from the ancillary packages with a nature oforder of Written to be entered without requiring an electronic signature.4>Yes (Exempt Service Entered)  Is the same as option 2 except that itwill allow orders sent from the ancillary packages that have not defineda nature of order to be entered without requiring an electronic signature.This is the way 'backdoor' orders were handled before the changes introduced with this new field (added with patch OR*2.5*46) were added.As of the release of patch OR*2.5*46 only Pharmacy and Lab have a wayof dealing with the nature of order from the backdoor.  So until therest of the backdoor interfaces can deal with this, option 4 is the least disruptive method of evolution, and still get the enhancements fornotification and signing of verbal orders.   For options 1,2,3 & 4, the default for the prompt "Do you want to markthese orders as 'Signed on Chart'" is changed to NO.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>unsigned orders screen</td><td>2;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:All<br/>1:Select<br/></td><td></td><td>This field controls the type of review screen that is usedfor new/unsigned orders. Without this parameter, the user has to sign all orders when entering new orders or presented with new /unsigned orders whenleaving the review screen.
