It is not meant to replace theofficial DAS at this time.  Data stored in this file will be differentfrom that in the DAS file (221).  This file will have a break down byindividual teeth and procedures that were used to create the record.These file entries will be created by the Document Storage Systems (DSS)Dental-GUI application.  The purpose of that application is to allow thecreation of records in this file.  But at the same time, it will createPCE workload entries and will also create a record in the Dental ActivitySystem (DAS) file (221).  This has the following advantages:  1. The DSS-GUI has one user interface for inputting data 2. The need for the dental card reader should be eliminated.  The cardreader should be kept for backup purposes 3. The dentist and assistants won't need to go into VistA PCE options torecord their workload 4. The dentists can do their Progress Note in the DSS-GUI which willdownload it to the VistA TIU package.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>record#(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the number of the record.
