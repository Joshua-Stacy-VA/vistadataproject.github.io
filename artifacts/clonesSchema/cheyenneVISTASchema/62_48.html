These messages are found in the LA7 MESSAGE QUEUE file (#62.49).When messages have status of "error" they remain on the system until theircorresponding error message is removed from the XTMP global by a KERNELcleanup task.

It applies to both order (ORM) and result (ORU)messages. When communicating with a VA facility this field can be left blank(default) or set to 0 - MULTIPLE PATIENTSIf the receiving system can only accept one patient per HL7 messagethen select 1 - SINGLE PATIENT. This will place multiple orders orresults for multiple orders in one message but only one patient willbe contained in the message.If the receiving system can only accept one order per HL7 message thenselect 2 - SINGLE ORDER. This will place in the message one order orthe results associated with one order for a single patient Note: An order in the VA is considered those tests found on oneaccession. What the VA considers as an accession other non-VA systemsmay refer to as an order.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>interface type</td><td>0;9</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:LAB UI<br/>10:LEDI<br/>20:POC<br/>21:POCA<br/>30:HDR<br/>40:OCS<br/>99:OTHER<br/></td><td></td><td>This field determines how and for what purpose this configuration isused. It allows the laboratory software to generate, handle andprocess messages. LAB UI - Used to identify configurations that are for processing         laboratory automated instrument data via a generic interface         manager.   LEDI - Designate entries involved with Laboratory Electronic Data         Interchange (LEDI). Used to identify interfaces involved in         the generation, transmission and processing of HL7 order (ORM)         and result (ORU) messages involving reference laboratory         testing between VistA and other VistA systems, commercial         reference laboratories, DoD laboratories and civilian         institutions.    POC - Point of Care (POC) interface. These interfaces transmit         laboratory test results for which there is no pre-existing         VistA laboratory order. VistA creates an order as part of         result processing and storage.   POCA - Point of Care interface that subscribes to HL7 patient         demographic (ADT) messages from VistA. Used by POC interfaces         that subscribe to patient information from VistA to maintain         the POC's patient database.    HDR - Designates interface to the VA Health Data Repository (HDR).         And those systems which subscribe to VistA Lab HL7 Result (ORU)         messages broadcast by VistA when lab results are made available           within VistA. Examples are COTS clinical decision support         systems.    OCS - Order Collection System. Interfaces involved in phlebotomy         and other specimen collection systems. Information regarding         lab orders and specimen requirement are transmitted to an         external system which assists in the specimen collection         and updates VistA Lab with information related to the specimen         and the related order/accession.  OTHER - Designate other non-laboratory interfaces that utilize the         Laboratory package.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>alert condition</td><td>20;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="62_481.html">62.481</a></td><td></td><td>This field allows the user to identify whether to receive alerts whenthere are new results, new orders or when an error is logged to the^XTMP global.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>non-va order snomed codes</td><td>SCT;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="62_482.html">62.482</a></td><td></td><td>Allows mapping a SNOMED CT code to specimen (topography) and/or collectionsample which an external system requires and which is different from theSNOMED CT code assigned to the concept by the Dept of Veterans Affairs.</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>remote system id</td><td>90;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="62_483.html">62.483</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to locate the correct configuration in this file whena message is received from a remote system. Most messaging protocolscontain information about the system that originated the message and thesystem that is the destination. Since there can be several senders andreceivers, this field can be used to determine the correct receiver byusing a special lookup on this field. The Universal Interface utilizesthis field in the following manner. The VISTA Health Level Seven (HL7) package requires that every messagemust have four fields in the message header so that it can determinethe application route for the message. Those four fields are calledSending Application, Sending Facility, Receiving Application, andReceiving Facility. The HL7 software must find values for each of thesefields in the message within the HL7 package files. The fields must matchin the following way. For HL7 v1.5 interfaces Sending Application = the NAME field (#.01) in  the HL7 NON-DHCP  APPLICATION PARAMETER file (#770) Sending Facility = the NON-DHCP FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 770 Receiving Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION  PARAMETER file (#771) Receiving Facility = the DHCP STATION NUMBER field (#2) in File 770  For HL7 v1.6 interfaces Sending Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION   PARAMETER file (#771) Sending Facility = the FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 771 Receiving Application = the NAME field (#.01) in the HL7 APPLICATION    PARAMETER file (#771) Receiving Facility = the FACILITY NAME field (#3) in File 771 For the Universal Interface, all four of those fields should be enteredinto this multiple field, exactly as they are entered in the HL7 fieldslisted above, including upper and lower case characters. No spaces shouldbe entered between the field values. An example of a Universal Interfacevalue for this field is listed below.LAB INTERFACEInstrument ManagerLA AUTO INST695 Where LAB INTERFACE is the NAME in File 770, Instrument Manager isthe NON-DHCP FACILITY NAME in File 770, LA AUTO INST is the NAME inFile 771, and 695 is the DHCP STATION NUMBER in File 770. When an HL7 message comes in, these four fields are taken out of themessage, concatenated together, and a lookup is done on the "C" crossreference to find this configuration and its associated parameters. Theprocessing routine can then continue to process the data. </td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><h2>Referenced by 3 types</h2><ol><li><a href="62_4.html">AUTO INSTRUMENT</a> (62.4) -- message configuration</li><li><a href="62_49.html">LA7 MESSAGE QUEUE</a> (62.49) -- configuration</li><li><a href="62_9.html">LAB SHIPPING CONFIGURATION</a> (62.9) -- lab messaging link</li></ol></div>
