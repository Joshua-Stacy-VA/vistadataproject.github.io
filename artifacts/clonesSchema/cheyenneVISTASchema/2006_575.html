The DICOM Image Gateway willpoll this file for corrected entries. The cross reference used to pollthis information is ^MAGD(2006.575,"AFX". The routine L^MAGDLB1 is used by the above menu options and will loop thruthe following cross reference ^MAGD(2006.575,"F".  This cross reference isset by the DICOM Study Instance UID; this is a unique number assigned bymodalities (imaging equipment) and is unique by case study.  So it ispossible to have over 20 entries in the file and only one unique "F" crossreference. </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>filepath(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The value of this field is a string that representsthe name of the image file that failed the matchingprocess on the local DICOM Image gateway processing the image.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>failed reason</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>NO CASE #:No case number<br/>PID ERROR:Could not match patient<br/>UNKNOWN:Any other reason<br/>BAD CASE #:Format error in case number<br/>CANCELLED:Case cancelled<br/></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a code that indicates thereason why the image file that is described in thecurrent entry could not be matched with a patientand study. The possible values for this field are NOCASE#, PATIENT, UNKNOWN or CANCELLED. When the entry is processed the match for the Radiology entry is bycase number and then by patient ID.
