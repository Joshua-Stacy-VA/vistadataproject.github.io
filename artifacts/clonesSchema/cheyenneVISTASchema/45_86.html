Itsmost important use is to determine who needs censustransactions sent to Austin.  All inpatients as of 11:59pmof the census date are listed in the Census Status Reportas needing a transaction. This date is usually the last date of the quarter, such as 12/31/2000. Please note, you are not allowed to enter a census date greater then the last day of the quarter.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>closeout date</td><td>0;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the last date census transactions can betransmitted to Austin.  This date is determined by VACO andshould only be changed as directed by VACO. Once this CLOSEOUT DATE has passed, census transactionsfor this census date are not allowed to be sent by the software.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>ok to xmit ptf transactions</td><td>0;3</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the date PTF records can be transmitted forpatients who also have census records for this census year. Note: Discharges that have admission dates after the census date      are not affected by this parameter.  PTF records for these      admissions can be transmitted in the usual manner. This date is determined by VACO and should only be changedas directed by VACO. If PTF transactions are transmitted to Austin before thisdate, the PTF transaction would overlay census transactionsfor the admission. It is possible to close and release PTF transactions. However, thesoftware will not allow the transmission of these PTFtransactions before this OK TO XMIT PTF TRANSACTIONS date.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>currently active?</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td>AC</td><td>This field indicates if this census date entry is the currentlyactive census.  There can only be one census date active atany one point in time.  It is possible not to have any censusdate active. The software enforces this 'only one active' rule.If a user attempts to have more than one census date active, s/he will get an error message indicating the census date thatis currently active.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>census period start date(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the first date of the census period.  Allspecialty movements and procedures that occurred for the inpatientfrom this date, CENSUS PERIOD START DATE, to the census dateshould be reported to Austin for the census. The software uses this date when creating the census recordfrom the PTF record.  Only those movements and procedures thatoccurred during that time frame are copied. This date is usually the first day of a Fiscal Year, such as 10/1/94for the 9/30/95 census.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>workfile last updated</td><td>0;6</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the date that the census workfile was lastupdated for this particular PTF census date entry. The 'Regenerate Census Workfile' option updates this field.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><h2>Referenced by 2 types</h2><ol><li><a href="45.html">PTF</a> (45) -- census date</li><li><a href="45_85.html">CENSUS WORKFILE</a> (45.85) -- census date</li></ol></div>
