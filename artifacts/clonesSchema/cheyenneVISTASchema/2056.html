A model number is selected from the ADP EQUIPMENT file (2056.31), and the associated data items (e.g.manufacturer, type of equipment, average cost, and VA System category)are taken from the ADP EQUIPMENT file (2056.31) and defined into the VHS&RAADP TRACKING SYSTEM file (2056). Additional fields relevant to the facilitywhich complete the description of the model number are: serial number, typeof purchase, P.O.number, quantity, date received and type of purchase. Forcomponents, two additional fields are described: the component's system,and the cabinet serial number in which the component resides. Three more fields are for field use only: service indentifier, location and comments.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>internal id#</td><td></td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the Internal Entry Number that data will be storedin your VHS&RA ADP TRACKING SYSTEM (2056) file.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the name of your facility.
