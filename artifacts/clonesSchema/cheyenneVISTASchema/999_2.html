Multiple realmscan be setup, each with its own unique TCP port.  Realms control whichdocuments may be accessed, whether user authentication is required, andother parameters which control server operation.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>server ip address</td><td>0;7</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the internet address of the node on which the server will run.If it is not specified, WebMan will attempt to determine the addressat runtime.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>main tcp port</td><td>0;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the TCP port number to be used by the master process for thisrealm.  HTTP servers use port 80 by default, but any unassigned portnumber may be used.  Check with your network administrator for guidance. All HTTP clients will attach to this port for their initial connection.If secondary ports are specified, the client will immediately beredirected to a free secondary port, if one is available.  If nosecondary ports are specified, all communication between the clientand server is done through the main port.  No other client will be ableto connect while an active connection is in progress. Under VMS, if this realm is being serviced by UCX then no port numberis required.  See the WebMan documentation for information on settingup WebMan under UCX control.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>starting port in pool</td><td>0;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This defines the first TCP port in the secondary port pool.  See thedescription of the MAIN TCP PORT field for information on portassignments. While main TCP port assignments must be unique across realms, secondaryport ranges may overlap across realms.  WebMan monitors which ports arein use and assigns only those ports that are free.</td></tr><tr><td>.13</td><td># ports in pool</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This defines the total number of ports in the secondary port pool.With field STARTING PORT IN POOL, this defines a range of portswhich are available for use by this realm.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>primary timeout</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>secondary timeout</td><td>0;6</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.5</td><td>home directory</td><td>.5;E1,240</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This defines the physical directory (path) which will serve as thelogical root directory for the realm.  It should be specified inthe format appropriate for the underlying operating system. For example, if the operating system is OpenVMS and the value ofthis field is DISK1:[WEBMAN], then all URLs passed to this realmwill be relative to this directory.  If the URL is:             http://indianapolis.med.va.gov/ftp/file.zip WebMan would look for the file in the physical directory             DISK1:[WEBMAN.FTP] This insures that clients can only access files within and descendantfrom the specified directory.  Of course, operating system fileprotections ultimately determine whether file access is permitted.It is therefore important to insure that the WebMan background processeshave been granted access to the necessary directories and files.</td></tr><tr><td>.9</td><td>shutdown server?</td><td>.9;1</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>When set to YES, any server processes (primary and secondary) are forcedto shutdown.  This field is automatically set by the options for startingand stopping server processes. This field has no effect on server processes under UCX control.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>html</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="999_201.html">999.201</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>map</td><td>2;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="999_202.html">999.202</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>cgi</td><td>3;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="999_203.html">999.203</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>user authentication</td><td>4;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is M code that performs authentication of the client process.  Ifthis field is not specified, no user authentication is required. Otherwise, this field should contain code that sets the value of $T totrue if the user has been authenticated, or false if not. Developers can create their own user database to control authenticationif they wish.  However, in most cases where authentication is desired,it should be done against the DHCP user database.  To accomplish this,enter the following M code in this field:          I $$LOGIN^RGWBSVR2(RGUSER,RGPASS) The variables RGUSER and RGPASS are set up by WebMan to contain theusername and password, respectively, passed by the client.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
