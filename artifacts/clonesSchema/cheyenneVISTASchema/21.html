This name should not be altered in any way norshould entries be added to or removed from this file.  This data ismaintained by the MAS package and all updates to it will be made by thatpackage during a release.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>abbreviation</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>C</td><td>This field contains an abbreviation for this period of service.  Outputsand displays may alternately display the abbreviation if insufficientroom exists for the full name of the period of service.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>code(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>D</td><td>This field contains the single character code by which this period ofservice is known.  This character is supplied by MAS VACO and MUST NOT BEALTERED.  This code is transmitted to Austin with PTF, OPC, and manyother DHCP packages and modules.  Editing of this code will have severenegative implications on the integrity of the data you are transmittingand it could cause rejected records and loss of reimbursement for yoursite.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>begin date</td><td>0;4</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the beginning date of this period of service whetherit be a war, conflict, police action, or period of peace.  This data isdetermined by MAS VACO and must not be altered in any way.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>end date</td><td>0;5</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the ending date of this period of service whether itbe a war, conflict, police action, or period of peace.  This data isdetermined by MAS VACO and must not be altered in any way.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>war/peace</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>W:WAR<br/>P:PEACE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field contains a set of codes to determine whether this period ofservice was a wartime period or a period of peace.  This information isdetermined by VACO and must not be altered in any way.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>latest dob</td><td>0;7</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the latest date of birth which a patient may have hadin order to participate in this period of service.  For example, If thisfield contained 1975, only persons born in 1975 or earlier would have beenold enough to serve during this period of service.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>inactive</td><td>0;8</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>If this period of service has been inactivated and should no longer beselectable, this field should contain YES.  Periods of service aremaintained by VACO and the MAS software module.  Therefore, thisinformation should not be altered by the site.  Should it be necessary toinactivate a period of service, this will occur through the release of theMAS module via a regular software release.</td></tr><tr><td>.09</td><td>ptf code(+)</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the code for this period of service which is transmittedas part of the PTF portion of the MAS module.  This field is determined byMAS VACO and is maintained by the MAS software module.  Editing of thisinformation can have severe negative impacts on the operation of the MASsoftware and may cause records to be rejected in Austin.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>eligibility</td><td>E;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="21_01.html">21.01</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple contains all eligibilities a person with this period ofservice may have.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>synonym</td><td>S;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="21_02.html">21.02</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple contains all alternate names by which this period of servicecan be selected.  Entry of either the period of service name or one ofthe synonyms contained in this multiple will cause this period of serviceto be selected.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>brief description</td><td>0;20</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains a brief description of this period of service.  It maycontain the date range for the conflict or a brief explanation of theperiod of service.  If the user enters two question marks at a PERIOD OFSERVICE prompt, this description will appear in addition to the period ofservice name and code.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><h2>Referenced by 4 types</h2><ol><li><a href="2.html">PATIENT</a> (2) -- period of service</li><li><a href="22.html">POW PERIOD</a> (22) -- code</li><li><a href="745_1.html">CONSUMER CONTACT</a> (745.1) -- period of service</li><li><a href="798_4.html">ROR PATIENT</a> (798.4) -- period of service</li></ol></div>
