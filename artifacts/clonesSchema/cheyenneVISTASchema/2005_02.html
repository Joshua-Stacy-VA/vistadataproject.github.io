It is exported with data. All sites must have entriesfor the data types distributed in order to display objects sent viamultimedia mail. The Object Type file handles objects of various types.  These include:   * still images   * image groups  * graphics or waveforms  * scanned documents  * audio files    Other types are expected in the future (i.e., image overlays,motion video chips, and office automation files).  An object,such as an image series, may actually consist of multipleobjects.  In this case, the object type is Group.  The ObjectGroup multiple field is used to point to a set of objects in theImage file.  Each object type has associated methods (softwareroutines) for performing certain actions.  For example, there aremethods for displaying images and image abstracts.  The grouptype is used to combine multiple objects of the same or differenttypes to create complex objects.  There are different image types, for example:   * black and white high-resolution x-rays  * black and white ultrasound images (lower resolution)  * pseudo-color nuclear medicine scans  * medium resolution true color bronchoscopy images  * pathology images  Each type of object has a number of specific characteristics,including the methods  required to display them.  For example,each object type has a type name and an associated display methodor window.  All accesses to objects use the file finder routine ^MAGFILE or^MAGFILEA to find the network location needed.  Different entrypoints of this routine will find locations of full files,abstract files, and jukebox copies of files.  In addition, thenetwork write location will be returned for image captures.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>MAG</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Each kind of data supported by the Imaging System has an entry inthe Object Type file.
