This relationship is used whenever a primary or othereligibility is assigned to a patient.  The ID FORMAT associated withthe assigned eligibility will be used to set the patient's longand short id. The default ID FORMAT is 'VA STANDARD'.  This format is the sameas the SSN. Currently, spring of 1991, the only sites using formats otherthen VA STANDARD are those sites running VA/DOD softwaredeveloped by the Dallas ISC. Those hospitals having VA/DOD sharing agreements may eventuallyadd other format types to help identify DOD patients.  However,the site should contact its support ISC before adding any newformats.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field holds the name of the id format.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>prompt user for id?</td><td>0;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>This field indicates whether the user is prompted for the patient's longidentification.
