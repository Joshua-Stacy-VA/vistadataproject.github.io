For VA purposes, impaired    hearing is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold    in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz is 40 dB    HL or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of    these frequencies are 26 dB HL or greater; or when speech recognition    scores are less than 94%.  2.
