The precise definition of the concept Polytrauma may prove to be a useful example. Although the term has become common among US Military and VA physicians to describe a seriously injured (i.e., Injury Severity Score (ISS) >= 16) soldier with multiple traumatic injuries, it is not yet available as a coded concept in eitherSNOMED CT, ICD-9-CM, or ICD-10-CM. Allowing the definition and deploymentof VHAT Concept/Designation VUID pairs to identify such problems inadvance of their acceptance by the international medical community willhelp to provide coded, computable documentation in a much more timelymanner than waiting for inclusion in SNOMED CT or ICD. When the infrastructure in VA's Enterprise Terminology Server (ETS) & NewTerm Rapid Turn-around (NTRT) service are ready to deploy VHAT Concepts, this field will allow us to store patient problems encoded with them.</td></tr><tr><td>80004</td><td>vhat designation vuid (future)</td><td>800;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>VHA Unique ID (VUID) for the VHAT Designation.
