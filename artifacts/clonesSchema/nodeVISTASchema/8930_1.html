If the AND FLAG has value OR, or has novalue, then User Class and User Role within the same entry are "OR'ed". Each file entry associates an action with 1 user class and/or 1 role.  Theentry makes this association for a given Document Definition (e.g.Progress Note) of a given status (e.g. Unsigned). Multiple file entries for the SAME action/Document Definition/documentstatus allow association with more than one user class/role.  Such entriesare "OR'ed":  that is, if a user belongs to the user class/role of one ORanother of these entries, the user may perform the action. User classes automatically INCLUDE user subclasses of the given class asdefined in the User Class file. Document Definitions exist in hierarchy in file 8925.1, with Classes atthe top level, Document Classes at the next level down, and Titles underDocument Classes.  Authorization/Subscription entries may be defined atany of the above levels.  For example, an authorization which applies tomost or all Progress Notes should be defined at the Class level forDocument Definition "Progress Note."  On the other hand, an authorizationwhich applies only to Progress Notes of Title "Dental Hygiene Note" shouldbe defined at the Title level for Document Definition "Dental HygieneNote". When using authorizations/subscriptions to determine whether a givenuser should receive/may perform a given action for a Document Definitionof a given Title, code begins by checking entries for that action andstatus FOR THAT TITLE.  If ANY such entries exist, then entries for higherDocument Definition levels will be ignored, and the user passes/failsbased on that level alone.  Thus, if a Title is linked with a certainaction, status and user class, then rules for that Title, action, andstatus should be entered for ALL user classes which can perform theaction on the Title, since broader authorization (e.g. Provider class)set at higher levels (e.g. Progress Notes) is ignored. If such entries do NOT exist, the next higher level of Document Definitionis checked.  And so on. If no entries are found on any level, no users can perform/subscribe tothe action for the given Document Definition and status.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>document definition(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8925_1.html">8925.1</a></td><td>B</td><td>This is a Document Definition of Type Class, Document Class, or Title fromthe Document Definition File 8925.1</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>status(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8930_6.html">8930.6</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>action(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8930_8.html">8930.8</a></td><td></td><td>This is the action to be permitted for a given document type and status.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>user class</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8930.html">8930</a></td><td>C</td><td>This is the User Class which is being authorized to perform an action on a document of the type and status indicated.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>and flag</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>&:AND<br/>!:OR<br/></td><td></td><td>This field allows the ADPAC to indicate whether the conditions specified by User Class and User Role should be logically "AND'ed," or logically "OR'ed," as they will be unless otherwise specified.  i.e., if you want to specify that an unsigned discharge summary may be signed by a user, where:User Class = Provider AND User Role = Author,then you'll want to set this field to AND.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>user role</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8930_2.html">8930.2</a></td><td>D</td><td>This identifies the role of the user with respect to the document inquestion (e.g., Author/Dictator, Expected Signer, Expected Cosigner,Attending Physician, etc.).</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>description</td><td>1;0</td><td>WORD-PROCESSING</td><td></td><td></td><td> For most entries, the meaning of the entry will be clear from thedescription of the associated event in the TIU Event file.
