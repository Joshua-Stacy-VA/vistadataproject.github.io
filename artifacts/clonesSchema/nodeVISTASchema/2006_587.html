Valid destinations for files that are transmittedusing the MS-DOS copy protocol are stored in the Network Locationtable (FileMan file #2005.2).Valid destinations for files that are transmitted using theDICOM C-Store protocol are stored in this file. For each destination, this table contains the identifying informationfor the destinations, as well as the identifying information forthe DICOM Gateways that are allowed to transmit images to thesedestinations. If multiple DICOM Gateways are allowed to transmitimages to a specific destination, this table will contain multipleentries for that destination, one for each source and destination pair.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>service name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The value of this field is a string that specifies the name of theservice that is called for the application described in the current entry.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>service provider ae</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a string that specifies the ApplicationEntity Title for the equipment being called for the application thatis described in the current entry.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>ip address</td><td>0;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a string that specifies the TCP/IP addressof the called application entity.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>port number</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is an integer number that identifies the TCP/IPport number to which the equipment connects calls the application thatis described in this entry. </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>gateway system title</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a text that identifies the computer thatcommunicates with this service class provider. Note that each VistA DICOM Gateway computer has its own copy of ^MAGDICOM,in which its station-parameters are stored.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>gateway ae</td><td>0;6</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a string that specifies the ApplicationEntity Title for the VistA DICOM Gatewat from which the application is calledthat is described in the current entry.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>gateway location(+)</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>The value of this field is a pointer to the Institution file (#4).This value identifies the institution where this DICOM Gateway computer resides.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>timestamp(+)</td><td>0;8</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>service type</td><td>1;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="2006_5871.html">2006.5871</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>scp type</td><td>0;9</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the Service Provider Type as entered in the SCU_LIST.DIC file.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><h2>Referenced by 1 types</h2><ol><li><a href="2006_035.html">SEND QUEUE</a> (2006.035) -- destination</li></ol></div>
