It is used to control the building of shipping manifests whichare used as shipping documents for the transport of clinical specimens betweenthe facilities which make up the configuration. It controls how the specimensare processed at both facilities and the means and methods used tocommunicate test orders and results for these two entities.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field is used to give a name to a pair of facilities that have enteredinto a relationship in which the collecting facility sends the host facilitylaboratory specimens for clinical testing.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>collecting facility(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td>C</td><td>This field is used to designate the collecting facility that is part ofa shipping configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>host facility(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to designate the host facility that is part of ashipping configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>.031</td><td>host facility's system(+)</td><td>0;11</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td>E</td><td>The name of the institution which houses the computer system of the hostwhich will be receiving the order.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>status</td><td>0;4</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:INACTIVE<br/>1:ACTIVE<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to designate whether this shipping configuration is"active", i.e. selectable by the user for use in building, processingand receipting shipments of laboratory test.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>collecting facility's spec id(+)</td><td>0;5</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:COLLECTING FACILITY<br/>1:HOST FACILITY<br/>3:SAME SYSTEM<br/></td><td></td><td>This field is used to determine the source of the specimen id (Lab UID) used to identify a specimen. It is used by the Host facility whenaccessioning tests requests from Collecting facilities to determine if the Host facility needs to generate a new specimen id/label or usethe specimen id/label from the Collecting facility. If both the Collecting and Host facilities on operating on the samecomputer system then select #3 - SAME SYSTEM.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>collecting facility's system</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="4.html">4</a></td><td>D</td><td>The name of the institution which houses the computer system from whichthe sender transmitted/sent the order.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>lab messaging link</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_48.html">62.48</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to link a shipping configuration with an electronictransmission of shipping manifests. When a shipping manifest is shipped,this field is checked to determine if the software should transmit the orderson the manifest to the host facility. It identifies the entry in the LA7MESSAGE PARAMETER file #62.8 to use for building and transmitting the manifest.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>shipping method</td><td>0;8</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="62_92.html">62.92</a></td><td></td><td>This field is used to designate the method of shipment used by a shippingconfiguration.

The regular style (code="YES"), whichwas released with the original version of Laboratory Electronic DataInterchange (LEDI), produces a long bar code. If the receiving site,which is reading these type of bar codes, has problems then switch tothe compact style (code="YES-COMPACT"). This will produce a shorter barcode.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>manifest receipt</td><td>0;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>0:NO<br/>1:YES<br/></td><td></td><td>Allows site to have a receipt printed with a shipping manifest when thestatus of the manifest is "SHIPPED". This receipt can be used to recordacknowledgment of receipt of the shipment by the courier service used totransport the specimens to the host facility.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>other system identifier</td><td>0;12</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If this entry is used to communicate with a non-VA, non-DoD system,enter the 2-3 alpha character identifier used to uniquely identifythis system. This identifier is used in constructing the HL7 application name andfacility and resolving identification of institutions during HL7message building and processing. This field is not used when VistA is communicating with a VA orDoD facility. These facilities are identified by their VA stationnumber or DoD DMIS ID respectively.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>account number</td><td>0;13</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>If the system that you are shipping to requires an account number forbilling or other purposes enter the number here.

If only specimens that have beenreceived in the lab, i.e. have a lab arrival time, are to build thenanswer "NO". If field is blank then default is "NO".</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>test coding system</td><td>0;15</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:NLT<br/>1:NON-VA<br/>2:LOINC<br/></td><td></td><td>If orders are being sent to a non-VA facility and the facilitycan not accept VA test order codes then answer with the type ofcoding system. "NON-VA" indicates that the other system is usinga local coding system. The laboratory shipping software will thenuse the non-VA test codes entered for each test on thisconfiguration. If the non-VA facility can accept VA test codes then answer "NLT"and the software will sent VA test order codes. VA test order codes are usually NLT codes but in the future maybe LOINC codes. Selecting "LOINC" is currently not supported.Support will be added in a future version of the LEDI softwarewhen LOINC coding has been implemented within VA facilities.</td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>specimen coding system</td><td>0;16</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:HL7 TABLE 0070<br/>1:LOCAL-NON HL7<br/></td><td></td><td>Collecting facility:If orders are sent to a non-VA facility and thefacility can not receive HL7 specimen codes from HL7table 0070 then answer with the type of coding system"LOCAL".Host facility:If orders are received from a non-VA facility and thefacility can not transmit HL7 specimen codes from HL7table 0070 then answer with the type of coding system"LOCAL".</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>ordering location</td><td>44;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="62_9003.html">62.9003</a></td><td></td><td>Use this field to specify specific ordering locations used by thisconfiguration. Only those ordering locations defined will attempt tobuild to a manifest related to this configuration. This field is useful when an accession area is shared by a division thathas multiple physical locations which ship independently of each other.It allows specimens from selected locations to build to a manifest andavoid adding specimens from other locations that match on other criteria- accession area, division, test. If there are no ordering locations specified then ordering location will not be a factor is selecting and placing an accession on a manifest related to this configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>test/profile</td><td>60;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="62_9001.html">62.9001</a></td><td></td><td>This multiple is used to define the tests and criteria that is used todetermine which tests/specimens are built on a shipping manifest usedby this configuration. If you need to have the same test in more than once to support differentspecimen/urgency criteria then enter the test name enclosed in "" to addthe same test.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><h2>Referenced by 1 types</h2><ol><li><a href="62_8.html">LAB SHIPPING MANIFEST</a> (62.8) -- shipping configuration</li></ol></div>
