These templatesallow management of the conversion process to meet the needs of theindividual site. Each template contains the following:      1) Start and End dates for encounters to be converted      2) Event logs (estimate, convert, re-convert)      3) Action logs (schedule, stop, re-start)       4) Error logs      5) Conversion event start/stop parameters      6) Estimate statistics      7) Record creation statisticsThe database conversion logic utilizes and updates the information stored ineach CST. </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>number(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the CST number.
