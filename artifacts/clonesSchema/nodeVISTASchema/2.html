At a minimum each patient entry must have a NAME, DATEOF BIRTH and SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  In order to add a new patient to thePATIENT file the user must also indicate whether or not the patient isrequesting to receive care as a VETERAN of the U.S. Armed Forces andspecify the TYPE of patient being added to the system.  For the mostpart the information contained in this file is demographic in nature,i.e., address, employment, service history, etc., however dataconcerning admissions, appointments,etc., is also stored in this file.The ADMISSION sub-field is scheduled to be moved into the new PATIENTMOVEMENT file by the end of calendar year 1989.  Care should be usedwhen removing a patient from the PATIENT file since virtually allother DHCP modules do utilize data from this file.  Of the many fieldsin the file you will note that many are preceeded by an asterisk.Those fields are scheduled to be removed from the file due to eitherlack of use or replacement by another field/file in the next release.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>LR;RA;PS;DG;SD;RT</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>Enter the patient's name in 'LAST,FIRST MIDDLE SUFFIX' format.This value must be 3-30 characters in length and may contain only uppercasealpha characters, spaces, apostrophes, hyphens and one comma.
