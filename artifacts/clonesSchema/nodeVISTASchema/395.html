On days that thenetwork is unavailable (weekends and holidays) this field willcontain the value of the previous network workday's date.  Forexample, on a Sunday, this field will contain the date of theprevious Friday. The value in this field is updated automatically by the system onworkdays when a HINQ request is sent.  It should not be necessary to edit this field.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>last net-workday</td><td>HQ;2</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field contains the date of the network workday that isprevious to the current network workday.  For example, on aTuesday, it contains Monday's date.  On a Sunday, the networkworkday is still Friday so Last Net-Workday will contain Thursday'sdate. When the parameter, NETWORK DAY, is updated on workdays, LAST NET-WORKDAYfield is automatically updated to the value of the previousNETWORK DAY. Thus at times LAST NET-WORKDAY can be days apart from NETWORKDAY because a HINQ hasn't been requested to update the field. For exampleif NETWORK DAY is a Monday and LAST NET-WORKDAY is Friday and no HINQsare done until Thursday, on Thursday the NETWORK DAY will containThursday's date but LAST NET-WORKDAY will contain Monday's date.  If a HINQ is done again on Friday then NETWORK DAY will be Friday's dateand LAST NET-WORKDAY will be Thursday's. VIEW THE HINQ SUSPENSE FILE option displays entries beginning with thecurrent day's date and going back to the LAST NET-WORKDAY'S date.  It may be necessary to edit this field to contain an earlier date toextend the date range of this options. On the following workday, this field will get updated as usual to the previous NETWORK DAY'S date.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>gmt offset</td><td>HQ;3</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This entry is derived from the time zone field of the Kernel parameterfile and the Mailman time zone file.

Enter a yes to enable theseoptions or a no to disable them. These options are automatically disabled during VBA computernon-workday hours.  However, it may be necessary to disable theseoptions temporarily if transmission problems are occurring.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>batch processing enabled</td><td>HQ;5</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This parameter is set to a YES or NO by the system to enable ordisable the option, PROCESS THE SUSPENSE FILE.  The option isautomatically disabled during VBA computer non-workday hours.When the option is selected during workday hours and this fieldcontains a NO, a test of the network is automatically performed.This field will be set to a YES or NO value that indicates whetheror not the HINQ Suspense file contains 'P'ending entries. Thesystem sets this field.  If this field is set to NO, queued jobswill quit before logging into the remote VBA.

This field isincremented by the system each time a process is automaticallyrequeued to the VBA computer.  It is reset to zero by the systemon workdays. To allow processes to be requeued, the number in this field mustnot be greater than the number in the AUTO-REQUEUE LIMIT field.If necessary, this field can be reset to zero by the user toallow additional processes to be requeued to the VBA computer.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>hinq mail messages</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>This field will allow the site to turn on the mailing of HINQ mailmessages when they process the suspense file.  </td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>new idcu interface(+)</td><td>HQ;11</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>When this field is set to YES, IDCU addressing is changed to accessa new interface at the RDPCs.through the mailman's queues.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>rdpc time difference</td><td>HQ;12</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>This field should contain the time difference between the site and the RDPC where HINQ requests are sent.
