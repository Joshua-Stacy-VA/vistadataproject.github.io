This file maps logical devicenames to physical device names, allowing continued operation even whennetwork storage devices are done. The Imaging site parameters has a numberof fields pointing to this file to locate where on the network differentfiles are written. Because the Imaging System operates in a distributedenvironment, an object may be stored on one or more of the network storagedevices.  These include multiple magnetic file servers, one or moreoptical jukeboxes, and possibly additional network devices accessedthrough a gateway.  Each logical location in the Network Location file is mapped to aphysical device.  Every physical device on the network that will be usedfor objects must have at least one entry in the Network Location file.  The Operational Status field allows rapid software reconfiguration in theevent of failure of one of the object storage devices.  Each network storage device has a type, such as magnetic or optical.This allows "automatic file migration," where an object resides on a fastmagnetic disk until 30 days since its last access, then it is moved toslower, less expensive optical media.  Three fields in the Image file (2005) are used to indicate the storagedevice(s) on which the object resides.  For example, an object mayoriginally be captured to MAG1, the first magnetic server.  Withinseconds, an abstract is created and stored on this same device; the Disk &Vol, Abstract field will be set to MAG1 also.  Next, the Image file willbe copied to the optical jukebox (if present on the network), creating animmediate backup copy.  The Disk & Vol, Optical field will now be set topoint to the optical device used for the optical copy.  The Network Location file was designed to allow access across a gateway.This type of access has not been required at the test sites.  We recommend using names for magnetic devices that begin with the threeletters, MAG, followed by sequential numbers.  We recommend that images bestored in directories named IMAGE at the first level.  Do not store anyfiles in this directory that are not objects handled by File 2005.  Logical names for Write Once Read Many (WORM) optical devices shouldstart with the four letters, WORM.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>MAG</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>network location(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This is the alias name of an Imaging share.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>place(+)</td><td>0;10</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="2006_1.html">2006.1</a></td><td></td><td>This field identifies the SITE PARAMETER file entry.
