Captions ofdata dictionary, form-only, and computed fields serve to identify forthe user the data portion of the fields.  Captions for these types offields are automatically followed by a colon, unless the Suppress ColonAfter Caption property is set to 'YES.'  A field with an ExecutableCaption must have '!M' as a Caption.</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>executable caption</td><td>.1;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter MUMPS code that sets the variable Y equal to the caption youwant displayed.  This code is executed and the caption evaluated wheneverthe page on which this caption is located is painted.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>field type</td><td>0;3</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>0:UNKNOWN<br/>1:CAPTION ONLY<br/>2:FORM ONLY<br/>3:DATA DICTIONARY FIELD<br/>4:COMPUTED<br/></td><td></td><td>Enter the field type. CAPTION ONLY fields are for displaying text on the screen. FORM ONLY fields are fields defined only on the form and are not tied to afield in a FileMan file. DATA DICTIONARY fields are fields from a FileMan file. COMPUTED fields, like form-only fields, are fields that are defined onlyon the form.  Associated with a COMPUTED field is a computed expression.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>display group</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Display group helps users resolve ambiguity when they attempt to ^-jump toa field that has a caption that is not unique.  If more than one field hasthe same caption, when users try to ^-jump to a field with that caption,they are presented with a list of fields to choose from.  The text in theDisplay Group property is displayed in parentheses after the caption tohelp the user identify the correct field. For example, if two fields have the caption 'NAME:', but one of thosefields has a Display Group 'Next of Kin', when users enter ^NAME, theywill be asked to choose between 'NAME' and 'NAME (Next of Kin)'.</td></tr><tr><td>3.1</td><td>unique name</td><td>0;5</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the unique name of the element on the block.  No two elements onthe block can have the same Unique Name.  Unique Names are never seen bythe user.  You can refer to an element on a block by its Unique Name insome of the ScreenMan utilities such as PUT^DDSVAL and $$GET^DDSVAL, andin the computed expressions of computed fields.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>field</td><td>1;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Enter the number or name of a field in the file defined by the datadictionary number for this block.</td></tr><tr><td>4.1</td><td>data coordinate</td><td>2;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Data coordinate is relative to the position of the block.

If any ofthe required fields have null values, no Save occurs.

If onlyone match is made to the user's lookup value, then ScreenMan will ask"OK?" instead of automatically selecting the found entry. This propertycorresponds to the "V" flag in the DIC(0) input variable to ^DIC and onlypertains to multiple-valued fields.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>sub page link</td><td>7;2</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>If you wish to take users to a pop-up page when they press <RET> atthis field, enter the Page Number of that page.  When users exit thatpop-up page, ScreenMan will automatically take them to the field followingthis field. You can also use the Parent Field property of the pop-up page to link afield to the pop-up page.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>branching logic</td><td>10;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This MUMPS code is executed whenever the user presses <RET> at thefield.  Here you can set DDSBR equal to the field, block, and page,separated by up-arrow delimiters, of the field to which you wish to takeusers when they press <RET>.  For example,      S:X="Y" DDSBR="TEST FIELD 1^TEST BLOCK 1^TEST PAGE 2" would take the user to the field with unique name or caption "TEST FIELD1" on the block named "TEST BLOCK 1" on a page named "TEST PAGE 2". Alternatively, if you wish to take users to another page when they press<RET> at this field, and then when they close that page, automaticallytake them to the field immediately following this field, you can setDDSSTACK equal to the page name or number of that page. The variable X contains the current internal value of the field, DDSEXTcontains the current external value of the field, and DDSOLD contains theprevious internal value of the field.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>pre action</td><td>11;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This MUMPS code is executed when the user reaches the field.

The "O" parameter has noeffect, since the Required property can be used to make a field required.The "A" and "B" parameters also have no effect. Free text fields can use the "U" parameter.List or Range fields can use the "C" parameter.Set of Codes fields can use the "X" and "M" parameters.</td></tr><tr><td>20.3</td><td>qualifiers</td><td>20;3</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This property corresponds to the second ^-piece of the DIR(0) inputvariable to ^DIR.
