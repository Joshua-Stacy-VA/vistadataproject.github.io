The generic extract functionality supports corporate level managementanalysis by providing reports that:  - summarize patient reminder compliance totals (not applicable,   applicable, due, not due) - summarize finding total counts that reflect the most recent findings   resulting from reminder evaluation - summarize finding total counts that reflect site activities during the   reporting month.   - list unique applicable patients included in the finding count (Patient   List is not sent to Austin) An extract definition may be manually run or set-up to automatically runmonthly or quarterly.  The extract can be defined to only produce compliancetotals, or to also include finding totals. Each extract definition identifies: -  Which type of totals the extract will create: compliance, finding  -  What patient list(s) should be created first, second, third, , and    what criteria should be used to build the patient list(s). -  For each patient list created when the extract is run, what reminders    should be run. -  For each reminder run, what findings found should be used to include    in finding count totals, based on the reminder status for each    patient, and pre-defined counting groups. -  Counting groups are used to define findings that may have been found    from reminder evaluation, as well as findings that may not be in the    reminder but need to be counted for utilization counts. -  Counts are accumulated depending on whether the reminder status was    applicable, not applicable, due or not due for the patient. -  Utilization counts count how many times the findings in a counting    group were entered during the reporting period for the patients in    the patient list. The extract definition also identifies the last extract reporting period runand the next reporting period to be run.  This information is used to supportmanaging extract runs.  The next reporting period is used by the nextautomated run to know which period should be run.   The reporting results are stored in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (#811.3) The national extract definitions are defined in this file to support genericextract and roll-up needs by facility. The generic extract tools provideoptions to: -  manage extract criteria  -  manage extract runs (manual and automated) -  manage transmissions to AAC -  view extract reporting results -  view the list of patients making up the patient denominator When analyzing the results of an extract run, it is important to take note ofthe following information before drawing conclusions: - list rule criteria used to create the target patient lists   (denominators) - reminder definition used to create applicable, not applicable, due and   not due compliance and finding totals - counting rules used to accumulate totals  - counting groups of findings and the type of totals accumulated (all   patients, applicable, due or not due patients) The following is a comparison of Reminder Due and Reminder Extract reportfunctionality:   Reminder Due reports:    Use report criteria and pre-defined report templates with location/clinic   stop, provider, and team lists to build the list of patients that will be    used to evaluate reminders.      National Reminder Due report criteria and pre-defined report templates are    not nationally distributed.    The Reminder Due report evaluates reminders and provides counts for Total   patients, applicable patients and patients due.    The patient with a Due status can be saved in a Reminder Patient List for   further follow-up Patient Demographic and Health Summary reporting.    The findings in the reminder are not used to accumulate counts.    An existing Reminder Patient List can be used to identify target patients,   instead of report criteria and report templates.    The Reminder Due report can be created in a Summary or detailed report   format, and is typically queued to run in a job during off-hours.  National extract reports:    Defines complex extract criteria into one extract definition that is   pre-defined as a national Reminder Extract Definition.    Pre-defined national extract criteria uses findings (reminder terms),   independent of a reminder definition, to build one or more lists of   patients that are used to evaluate one or more reminders.    National extract criteria used to identify patients is similar to VA   External Peer Review (EPRP) performance measure reporting criteria.     EPRP performance measures often require a current qualifying visit and   an anchor visit during the previous year. Since some patients seen   during a reporting month do not have a prior year anchor visit, the   national extract's total patient counts for a given month will   typically be less than the Reminder Due report's total patient counts   for the same month.    The lists of patients used for each reporting period's national   extract are stored on the local system for sites to validate the   patient denominator counts and provide local quality of care   monitoring.    Compliance total counts are accumulated based on the reminder status   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due, and not   due.  The extract criteria used to create the totals is stored with    the total counts on the local system, as well as transmitted to the   AAC.    Finding total counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups   based on the findings found during reminder evaluation for the patient. The   finding counts are totaled into categories that reflect the reminder status   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due and not due patient   counts.  The finding counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria    used to create the counts.    Utilization counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups   that count how many times specified findings were entered during the    reporting period for patients for each patient denominator.  The finding    counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria used to create the    counts.    Each patient that had a finding count is stored on the local system for   follow-up patient care and validation of reporting results. The patients are   not sent to the AAC.    The national extract tools use Mailman links with the HL7 interface to send   compliance totals and finding totals for each monthly period to the AAC. AAC   adds the national monthly reporting to the Compliance Totals National    Database stored at the AAC.    The national extract reports are generated by a job. IRM Staff can help set   up each type of extract definition to automatically reschedule itself to run   monthly at each site. The extract run needs to occur prior to the tenth of   each month.     The sites can manually rerun an extract and/or selectively retransmit an   extract to AAC in the event of a failed transmission. The Extract Summary   reports may be used to verify compliance totals.      Parties interested in viewing the AAC Compliance Totals National Database   may be granted read-only access to this data.  The AAC uses the   national database to create Simple Authentication and Security (SAS)   files with read-only access. File relationships:    The extract definition uses list rules (#810.4) to build lists of patients.   If the extract definition is for Compliance and Finding Totals, the extract   definition will be defined with counting rules (#810.7). The counting rules   will be defined based on counting groups (#810.8).     Data from the extract is stored in the extract summary file (#810.3) and    patient lists are saved in the patient list file (#810.5). HL7 messages    containing the extract data from the extract summary (#810.3) are passed   to the HL7 package for transmission to the AAC. Individual patient   level data is not sent to Austin. However, a list of patients with   particular findings may be stored in the extract summary file (#810.3)   for validation of patients. Nationally distributed definitions are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot be modified by site.   Sites should name locally created extract definitions according to their local naming convention.  </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>The NAME of the extract (VA-IHD QUERI, VA-MH QUERI etc.).

Counting rules indicate how to count findings defined in a counting group. Counting Groupsoften group patient cohort findings, resolution findings and information findings in different groups.
