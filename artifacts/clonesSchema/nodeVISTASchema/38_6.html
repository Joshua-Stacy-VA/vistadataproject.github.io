Thisnumber is used by the consistency checker routines to determine what actionneeds to be taken.  Entries in this file must not be added nor altered inany way as this would cause the consistency checker functionality to actincorrectly.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name of the inconsistency that will be reportedwhen utilizing various registration and consistency checker options.

If the data has been verified,the user must hold a key in order to make a change to it.  If theinconsistency in this file requires a user to hold a key to edit the dataonce it has been verified, that key must be listed here. Altering of data in this field could cause data to be editedinappropriately.  This field should not be changed!</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>set elig dr string</td><td>0;4</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>If the data required to clean-up this inconsistency requires editing ofdata that is related to eligibility, this field should be answered yes.For example, if the inconsistency is 'SC PROMPT UNANSWERED', this fieldwould be yes because this prompt is required in order to select apatient's eligibility.  If this field is answered yes, all eligibilityrelated questions will also be asked. Data in this field must not be altered in any way or it could causeinaccrarate patient data to be entered on your system.
