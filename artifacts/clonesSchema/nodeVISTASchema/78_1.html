If there is a complication during an exam,then the technologist can indicate which of these complications in thisfile the exam should be associated with by using either the 'Case No. Edit'or 'Edit Exam By Patient' functions of the module. When the system is initialized, two complications are loaded into themodule. They are 'no complications' and 'contrast reaction'. If a 'contrast medium reaction' is associated with an exam, then thepatient's record in the Allergy Tracking System will automatically beupdated to indicate he/she has had a reaction. As a result, everytime thepatient is registered for a procedure that may involve contrast material,the receptionist will be warned and he/she should then take appropriateaction. Entries in this file should not be deleted.  Adding new entries is alwaysallowed.  Data Storage ------------The data for the 'COMPLICATIONS TYPE' file is stored in the ^RA(78.1,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates ---------------The package does not use any input templates associated withthis file.  Print Templates ---------------The package does not use any print templates associated with thisfile.  Sort Templates --------------The package does not use any sort templates associated with thisfile.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>complication(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the name of the type of complication that may beassociated with an exam.   Initially, the system contains two complication types:  'ContrastReaction', and 'No Complication'.

If this field contains a 'Yes',then it triggers a contrast medium as an allergen in the Allergy TrackingSystem.  As a result, whenever the patient is registered for a procedurethat involves contrast material, a warning message is displayed to thereceptionist.  Answering 'Yes' to this field also affects theComplications Report, since contrast medium reaction complicationsare tallied in an extra total line.</td></tr></tbody></table></dd></dl></div></div><hr><div class="fmqlResults"><p>Not Referenced</p></div>
