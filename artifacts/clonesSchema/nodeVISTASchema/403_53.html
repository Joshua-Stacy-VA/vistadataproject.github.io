This entry can be your site's name. But, if your site has areas that want to have different settings for notification type, timeframe to send out cards/letters or the number of days to scan for looking at scheduled appointments then you would want separate entries.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>type of notification</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>L:LETTERS<br/>C:CARDS<br/></td><td></td><td>How should this Recall Reminder Division send out Notifications. </td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>auto print days</td><td>0;4</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>Please put in the number of days ahead of the Recall Reminder date that you would like to send out Notification.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>clean up day setting</td><td>0;5</td><td>NUMERIC</td><td></td><td></td><td>A background job runs nightly to delete recall reminders from the RECALL REMINDERS file if an appointment has been scheduled for the patient at the requested clinic.
