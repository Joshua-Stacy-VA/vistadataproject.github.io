If the first few characters arenot unique, then the technologist will always have to respond to another'Select' prompt when entering only the first few characters.  To avoidthis second prompt, the technologist will have to enter many characters. Entries in this file should not be deleted. Adding new entries is alwaysallowed.  Data Storage ------------The data for the FILM SIZES file is stored in the ^RA(78.4,global. At the present time this file is very static after day-oneinitialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.  Input Templates ---------------The package does not use any input templates associated with thisfile.  Print Templates ---------------The package does not use any print templates associated with thisfile.  Sort Templates --------------The package does not use any sort templates associated with thisfile.</dd><dt>applicationGroups</dt><dd>RA</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>film(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the names of the types of films that the hospital usesin performing rad/nuc med exams. The names are specified by the rad/nuc med coordinator at each site andmust be 3 to 30 characters in length.  They should be set up with uniquefirst few characters to allow the technologist to use the first fewcharacters only to specify a film type.  This speeds up processing timewhen this field is used for exam status tracking. For procedures which do not involve films, 'No Films' may be entered here. For entries that indicate a 'wasted' film type, it is recommended that thename should begin with 'W.' or 'W-' to be easily recognized during caseediting.  For example:  '10x14' and 'W-10x14' would both be entered, andW-10x14 would be the 'wasted' film type.  When editing the 'W-10x14entry, you would answer 'Yes' at the 'Wasted Film?' prompt and enter'10x14' at the 'Analogous Unwasted Film Size' prompt.  When editing the'10x14' entry, answer 'No' at the 'Wasted Film?' prompt and you will notbe prompted for 'Analogous Unwasted Film Size'.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>is this a 'cine' film size?(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>Y:YES<br/>N:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>If this field contains a 'Yes', it indicates that this is cine feet filmtype.
