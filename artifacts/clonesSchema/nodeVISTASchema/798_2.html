There aretwo kinds of rules: top-level and lower level. If a rule is referenced by the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file, it is the top-level rule.Non-zero value of any top-level rule expression directly determines that the patient should beadded to the corresponding registry. Lower level rules are referenced only by other rules (by rule macros in the expressions). Theirexpressions are evaluated in the proper order, andthe result values are used in the expressions of other rules. Lower level rules have an indirectimpact on the final result and can be used forcomplex processing of linked files and multiples. For example, a lower level rule can calculate maximum and minimum values of a parameter in thesub-file, and a top-level rule will analyze thesevalues and decide if the patient should be added to the registry. Moreover, they could be used tosplit a very complex rule into several simplerrules. Records of the file are uniquely identified by therule name (the "A" primary key and the uniquenessindex "B" are used for this purpose).</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>rule name</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>YOU MUST NOT EDIT THIS FIELD IF IT IS A PART OFNATIONAL REGISTRY DEFINITION! Selection rule name must be unique and name spaced.
