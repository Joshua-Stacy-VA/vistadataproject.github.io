If the social security number is unknown and you need to assign a pseudo SSN follow it with a 'P', i.e., 123456789P.  Simply enter a 'P' if you wish the system to determine the proper pseudo SSN. Pseudo SSN's are determined as follows:      1.  Based on the following table assign the first three numbers       of the pseudo SSN based on the patient's three initials in       first-middle-last initial order.  For example, if the name       is 'SMITH,JOHN P' the table would be used to convert JPS       (the initials for JOHN P SMITH) into 467.           ALPHA     NUMBER              ALPHA      NUMBER       -----     ------              -----      ------       A,B,C       1                 D,E,F        2       G,H,I       3                 J,K,L        4       M,N,O       5                 P,Q,R        6       S,T,U       7                 V,W,X        8       Y,Z         9                 NO INITIAL   0      2.

Where a month, day or year consists of       less than one numeric, i.e., JUNE=6, preceed it by a zero, i.e.,       JUNE=06.
