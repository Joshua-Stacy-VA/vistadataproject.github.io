There are two steps in creating acomputed finding. First a MUMPS routine must be written. Informationabout how to do this can be found in the Clinical Reminders ManagerManual. The second step is to make an entry in this file, whichcontains a list of reminder computed findings. There are four fieldsfor each entry; they are: NAME - this is the name of the computed finding. When adding a computedfinding as finding to a reminder definition or term, it is done usingthe name. For example, you would type CF.VA-BMI to add the exportedVA-BMI computed finding to your reminder definition. ROUTINE - this is the name of the MUMPS routine. ENTRY - this is the entry point in the MUMPS routine. PRINT NAME - this will be displayed on the Clinical Maintenancecomponent as the name of the computed finding. If it is blank, then NAMEwill be used.TYPE - this is a set of codes that specifies what type of computedfinding this is. "S" stands for single occurrence, "M" for multiple occurrence,and "L" for list. If it is blank, single will be assumed.This file contains a combination of nationally distributed and localentries. Nationally distributed entries have their name prefixed withVA-. Local entry names cannot start with VA-.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of the computed finding and is the name the User willuse when adding a computed finding to a reminder definition or a term.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>routine</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is the name of an M routine that contains the code for thecomputed finding.
