This could be used foraccessions (e.g. recruits), deployments (e.g. Soldier Readiness Processing),or for any group of patients needing the same prescription or set ofprescriptions. Users create new Patient Batches in the Batch PrescriptionEntry option (Menu Path: CA-PHR-OPM-PM-SPM-BPE). Patient Batches areDivision-specific; users can only access Patient Batches that belong to theDivision they are logged into.  Users must be given the PSO PATIENT BATCH security key for access to theBatch Prescription Entry option. Also, the MTF must define the Default forPatient Batches in the Outpatient Site Parameters. One Outpatient Site perDivision must be defined as the Default for Patient Batches. From the Batch Prescription Entry option, users can enter RXs, print reports,print labels, dispense RXs, and cancel RXs for the Patient Batch. Theseactions are done for the entire Patient Batch, not individually by patient.  After entering RXs for the batch, users can print a Warning Report to seewhich patients have batch-entered RXs in a Warnings status. Users can thenindividually clear/resolve those warnings in the existing Clear ClinicalScreening option.  RX labels for all batch-entered RXs are generated using the Labels actionwithin the Batch Prescription Entry option. Labels for batch-entered RXs donot print with other labels in the BPL option.  Entries in this file are automatically inactivated 60 days after the batchwas last modified (this includes the batch being created, patients beingadded/removed, or being modified). Patient Batches can also be manuallyinactivated at any time. Patient Batches are purged 30 days after becominginactive.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>PATIENT BATCH NAME(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>B</td><td><SYN>Enter the NAME of the batch of patients.
