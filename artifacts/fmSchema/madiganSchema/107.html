One Order may produce oneor many tasks (eg. a medication QID produces four tasks per day). One maythink of the posting of a task as similar to an Order Requisition inmanual Order Entry. For each task, the two cross references are producedwhich act as the requisition. Each of the Ancillaries is looking fornew requisitions on a regular basis. As the requisition is processed, thecross reference is killed. Finally, the status of the task is updatedas appropriate by the ancillary. </dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.001</td><td>NUMBER</td><td/><td>11</td><td/><td/><td>Field allows a number between 0 and 10000000.</td></tr><tr><td>.01</td><td>DATE/TIME(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>DATE-TIME</td><td/><td>B</td><td>This field holds the date/time a task is to be carried out, and not thetime the Order was created. If a task is schedulable, the Order processinitially assigns a 'Requested Date/time'. Once the Ancillary has createdthe appointment, the 'Actual Date/time' is substituted in this field withappropriate update of cross references.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>ORDER</td><td>0;2</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="101.html">101</a></td><td>C</td><td>Each task is associated with one and only one Order. One Order may producemany tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>.03</td><td>ORDER TYPE</td><td>0;3</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="102.html">102</a></td><td/><td>A duplicate of the same field found in the Order file, put here because ofthe frequent need to know this in relation to Tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>.04</td><td>TASK STATUS</td><td>0;4</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td/><td>A free text field allowing each ancillary to place status flags atappropriate times.

In the Order File, thePending Schedule flag reflects the condition of tasks due to be processedTODAY. For example, if there are two Chest Xrays ordered for today, butonly the first has a confirmed schedule, the Order will be considered tobe in Pending Schedule as a reminder that there could be a problem withan important study and Xray may need a phone call.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>TASK COMPLETED</td><td>0;6</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:COMPLETED<br/></td><td/><td>This flag is a uniform way each Ancillary can note completion of thetask.
