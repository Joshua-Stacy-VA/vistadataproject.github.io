Names should be unique (that is, do not assigna name to more than one room, group, or portable unit).  Forexample, if you have three ultrasound rooms in your MTF, then tomake the name of each room unique, you might assign the namesULTRASOUND1, ULTRASOUND2, and ULTRASOUND3.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>EXTERNAL SCHEDULING ONLY</td><td>0;8</td><td>12</td><td/><td>This field is used to identify a room for external scheduling only.  Whenset to YES, the room will not be available for selection via RadiologyExam Scheduling options.Leaving the field blank will make the room available for CHCS Radiology scheduling.  Auditing will be applied to this field to track changes,capturing the user, previous value and date/time of change.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DESCRIPTION</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td/><td>C</td><td>Enter a 3- to 40-character description of this room, room group, orportable unit.  The description should indicate the type(s) ofprocedures performed in the room or by the portable unit (forexample, ULTRASOUND or CHEST).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>IS THIS A ROOM GROUP?(+)</td><td>0;3</td><td>12</td><td/><td>Enter Y for YES if this room is a room group.  Enter N for NO ifthis room is not a room group.  A room group is defined as a groupof rooms that are used for the same or similar purposes whenscheduling procedures.  For example, if there are three rooms inwhich the same procedures are performed, and the scheduling ofthese procedures could take place in any of the three rooms, theserooms could be classified as a group.  When the system searches fora room in which to schedule the procedure, it searches all threerooms for open times and schedules accordingly.  An example of aroom group would be RAD RM GRP.  This room group could include RADRM 1, RAD RM 2, and RAD RM 3.</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>IS THIS A 'PORTABLE' ROOM?</td><td>0;5</td><td>12</td><td/><td>Enter Y for YES if this "room" is a portable unit.  Enter N for NOif it is not a portable unit. NOTE:  If a procedure is done portably only, then you must enterthis "room" in the PERFORMING ROOMS field in the Procedure FileEdit option.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>RADIOLOGY LOCATION(+)</td><td>0;4</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="79_1.html">79.1</a></td><td>D</td><td>Enter the name of the radiology location to which this roombelongs.  This field points to the Radiology Location file (#79.1),which is populated via the option Enter/Edit Radiology LocationParameters.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>CROSS-DIVISION SCHED</td><td>0;6</td><td>12</td><td/><td>This field determines whether one division can scheduleappointments in another division at your MTF.  Data should beentered in this field if your MTF is multidivisional. Enter Y (for YES) if you want the CHCS to allow cross-divisionalscheduling at your MTF.  If this field is set to YES, then you mustenter data in the following fields:  CROSS-SCHED DIVISION,CROSS-SCHED DAYS, CROSS-SCHED START TIME, and CROSS-SCHED END TIME. Enter N (for NO) if you do not want the CHCS to allowcross-divisional scheduling at your MTF.  Set this field to NO ifyour MTF is not multidivisional.  If you leave this field blank,then the CHCS defaults to the NO setting.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DIVISION</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="40_8.html">40.8</a></td><td/><td>This field is being evaluated for deletion from the DD.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>ROOM SET</td><td>R;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="78_61.html">78.61</a></td><td/><td>This field is a multiple containing the subfield that defines whichrooms are in this room group.</td></tr><tr><td>200</td><td>SCHEDULE DATES</td><td>SC;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="78_62.html">78.62</a></td><td/><td>This field is being evaluated for deletion from the DD.</td></tr><tr><td>300</td><td>CROSS-SCHED DIVISIONS</td><td>D;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="78_63.html">78.63</a></td><td/><td>This field is a multiple containing the subfields that define thedivisions, days, and times that cross-divisional scheduling areallowed.</td></tr><tr><td>400</td><td>CROSS-SCHED TIMES</td><td>T;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="78_64.html">78.64</a></td><td/><td>This field is a multiple containing subfields that define the daysand times that the CHCS allows cross-divisional scheduling at yourMTF.</td></tr><tr><td>500</td><td>EXTERNAl SCHEDULE AUDIT</td><td>A;0</td><td>MULTIPLE</td><td><a href="78_65.html">78.65</a></td><td/><td>auditing data for external scheduling only field</td></tr><tr><td>8196</td><td>DBA INACTIVE FLAG</td><td>28;1</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>1:INACTIVE<br/></td><td/><td>Enter 1 to inactivate this room.
