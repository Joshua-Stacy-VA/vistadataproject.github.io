EOD compliance is tracked forlocation types 'C' and 'S' (clinics and APUs) for clinic visits (excludestelephone consults and IBWA locations). The data in this file is populated automatically by the GSEODTSKroutine, as the GS POPULATE EOD COMPLIANCE option, tasked to run dailyat 0002; it should not be modified by other routines or by users. Tominimize the disk storage requirements, there is no 'B' cross referenceassociated with this file; reports referencing EOD compliance shouldjump to this file from the PATIENT APPOINTMENT file (#44.2).  The daily process that populates this global, evaluates EOD compliancefor appointments from the previous calendar day. Appointments that donot have a GS EOD COMPLIANCE record were entered into CHCS and backdatedusing EOD processing.</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>APPOINTMENT(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="44_2.html">44.2</a></td><td>B</td><td>This field contains the IEN of the PATIENT APPOINTMENT record for whichthe EOD compliance was determined.
