Ifthe system can determine the LOINC code, it is automatically assigned.  ForMycobacterium accessions, a LOINC code is captured for each Mycobacterium TBidentified.                 Data in this field is the actual LOINC code value determined for this test. The data is the same as the .01 field of the LOINC Codes file (file #8188).Note this field is NOT a pointer field. This is to allow test results andLOINC codes to be assigned that may not be in the LOINC codes file. A LOINCcode which is not in CHCS may be captured from an off-board system via anHL-7 message when the off-board system is using a different version of theLOINC tables.                 Data in this field should not be modified by the user and is generally hiddenfrom most data entry mechanisms. </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>RESULT TYPE(+)</td><td>0;2</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>I:INTERMEDIATE<br/>F:FINAL<br/>#I:INTERMEDIATE REPORT-PRIORITY<br/>#F:FINAL REPORT-PRIORITY<br/>/A:AMENDED FINAL REPORT<br/></td><td/><td>This field contains a set of internally stored codesfor indicating whether the results are INTERMEDIATE,FINAL, or AMENDED.
