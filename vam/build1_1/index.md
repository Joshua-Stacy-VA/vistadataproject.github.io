Need to further emphasize move off VISTA and quantity of data now retired in VISTA vs that needs a VISTA shadow for now.

Rough notes:
  * show VICS Server manager
    * want to show extend of VISTAs and their datasets as well as traffic
    * VISTAService (vs CPRSService) to centralize managing many VISTAs
  * [may show > 1 VISTA - this may come in mid March]
  * CPRS preferences (and VICS only parameters) now centralized (may need some CPRS prefs to wrap parameter service unlike B1)
  * Traffic encrypted (to the VICS Server)

Bring out
  * [Security Highlight] restrict user/duz pass ins ie/ enforce can't ask on behalf of another user ... ex/ _ORQQPL INIT USER_
  * [VISTA Turn off] migrated User to VAM
  * [Centralize Preferences] ... CPRS in general and per service. Per service could apply to Web Client too (validate)
