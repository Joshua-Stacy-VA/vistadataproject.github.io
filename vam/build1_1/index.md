Rough notes:
  * show VICS Server manager
    * want to show extend of VISTAs and their datasets as well as traffic
    * VISTAService (vs CPRSService) to centralize managing many VISTAs
  * [may show > 1 VISTA - this may come in mid March]
  * CPRS preferences (and VICS only parameters) now centralized (may need some CPRS prefs to wrap parameter service unlike B1)
  * Traffic encrypted (to the VICS Server)
