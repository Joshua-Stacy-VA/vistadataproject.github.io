## Build Web 1 (of 3) (February 15th, 2018)

The VICS Client [a] establishes an open source, industry-standard development framework for clinical and non clinical, web-based VICS clients, [b] demonstrates that such clients can operate seemlessly along side CPRS and [c] shows that a client with _national scope_ is enabled by VICS.

VAM has three _PDE Clinical Web Client_ (_"VICS Client"_) releases:
