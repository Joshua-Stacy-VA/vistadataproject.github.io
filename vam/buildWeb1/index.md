## Build Web 1 (of 3) (February 15th, 2018)

VAM has three Web releases.

(follow flow of [vistadataproject.info/vam/build1/](http://vistadataproject.info/vam/build1/))

First release [demo](demo/)

__Important to emphasize__:
  * motif/approach and have screenshots that just go into the underlying flexible framework
  * also that we can even add "information dense" motifs inside widgets once we get basic display/data entry done (Dr Richards is big into Dense Displays)
