## Build Web 1 (of 3) (February 15th, 2018)

The VICS Client [a] establishes an open source, industry-standard development framework for clinical and non clinical, web-based VICS clients, [b] demonstrates that such clients can operate seemlessly along side CPRS and [c] shows that VICS directly enables clients with cross VA as opposed to per-VISTA scope.

This Web Client will cover all the relevant functionality of CPRS in a web-friendly form and deliver modern visual motifs and features missing from CPRS such as auto-complete in search dialogs and ease of personalization.

VAM has three _PDE Clinical Web Client_ (_"VICS Client"_) releases:

Release | Name | Content | Due
--- | --- | --- | ---
W1 | Establish | [a] Basic GUI Component Framework, [b] Client Superstructure and Key Widgets, [c] __Subset of CPRS__, [d] against nodeVISTA__ (from VDP) | February 18
W2 | CPRS Cover Complete | [a] __CPRS-compatible and equivalent__ Client for User, Division, Patient and three PDE domains, [b] uses __VICS for Meta Data__ | May 18
W3 | Scalable National Client | [a] __Exclusively uses VICS__,<br>[b] all CPRS interaction scenarios (locking),<br>[c] cross VA, national client (VICS station #),<br>[d] AWS deployment,<br>[e] Proven scaling | August 18
