## Build 2 Milestone

> Build 2 __completed the emulation__ of the [143 RPCs](routerManagementRPCList) planned for IOC, adding Patient data handling to the Meta data supported in Build 1.*. 
>
> It sets the stage for Build 3 to __establish that VICS is demonstrably better, in multiple ways__ at delivering “VISTA Level Services” than "Legacy" VISTA itself.
