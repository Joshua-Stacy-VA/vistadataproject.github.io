From RPC Meta__
  * the RPC models list their files - ex/ https://github.com/vistadataproject/VICSServer/blob/master/emulation/models/orwdal32-allergy-match.js#L53) - the secondaries are referenced by the primaries ... (__data to sync__)
  * The same principle applies to parameters - https://github.com/vistadataproject/VICSServer/blob/master/emulation/models/orwch-loadall.js#L13 - this is how we'll know what parameters we're moving to VICS. (__parameters migrated__)

TODO: 
  * many RPCs to smaller # services
  * normalize service APIs as REST em
