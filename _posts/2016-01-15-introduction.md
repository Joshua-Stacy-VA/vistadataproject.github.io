The VISTA Data Project is a new data-centric approach to comprehensively exposing, representing, and managing the thirty-five years of patient data and institutional know-how currently in the VA's 131 nationally deployed health information systems (VISTA) using a modern web-standard machine-processable data model; and by enriching and operationalizing this model, make all relevant VISTA data securely accessible and computable across all VISTA systems through one national, standard Master VISTA Data Model (MVDM).
