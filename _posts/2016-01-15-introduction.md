The Veterans Information System Technology Architecture (VISTA) is the comprehensive longitudinal health information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). For the past thirty-five years, a national network of VISTA systems has provided all clinical, financial, and administrative functions to support the operations of 1200  VA hospitals and clinics throughout the United States. See [VISTA Background](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/tree/master/Background/vista)

The VISTA Data Project is a new data-centric approach to comprehensively surfacing, representing, and managing the thirty-five years of patient data and institutional know-how currently in the VA's 130+ VISTA systems using a modern  web-standard machine-processable Linked Data Model; and by enriching and operationalizing this model, make all relevant VISTA data securely accessible and computable across all VA VISTA systems through one single, standardized Master VISTA data model.
