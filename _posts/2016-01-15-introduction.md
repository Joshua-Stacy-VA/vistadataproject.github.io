VA Information Systems Technlogy Architecture (VISTA)

The VISTA Data Project is a new data-centric approach to comprehensively surfacing, representing, and managing the thirty-five years of patient data and institutional know-how currently in the VA's 130+ nationally deployed health information systems (VISTA) using a modern  web-standard machine-processable data model (RDF); and by enriching and operationalizing this model, make all relevant VISTA data securely accessible and computable across all VISTA systems through one standard master VISTA Data Model.
