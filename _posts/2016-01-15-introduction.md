The VISTA Data Project is a Federal Inter-Agency health systems innovation project funded by the Veterans Affairs (VA) to 

> provide a comprehensive, security-enabled, symmetric read/write master data model for all VA VISTA data across all VA VISTA operational systems, establishing a common technical foundation for master data management and computable data representation and exchange between VA and DoD clinical information systems.

How does this work? 

>__Executive version__:  All sources of relevant metadata (internal to VISTA as well as external) will be transformed to a single integrated web-standard data model which is then annotated, normalized, and enriched. This enriched model is embedded back in VISTA and operationalized as a server-side, security-enabled, in-process, symmetric read/write transactional Master VISTA Data Model.

and for the hipsters...

__How?__

>__All sources of available metadata and models__ (both internal to VISTA as well as external) will be __transformed to a single integrated web-standard data model__ which is then __annotated, normalized, and enriched__. This enhanced model is in turn is __embedded back in VISTA as a server-side, security-enabled, transactional (i.e. computable) read/write Master Data Model__.

__Where?__

>__All artifacts and deliverables__ shall be developed, version-controlled, stored, and delivered on an industry-standard __public Github__ repository (“Project Repository”). ... The Project Repository shall contain the one and only authoritative version of all artifacts produced ... The government, all necessary stakeholders, and the __public__ shall have full read and download access of all artifacts on the Project Repository at all times --- See [PWS](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/blob/master/Submissions/src/VistAMetadata-2015-12-09-PWS.pdf) Section 1.6.15.1


## The Result

The resulting Master VISTA Data Model embedded within the VISTA data engine will provide a server-side, security-enabled, in-process, symmetric read/write Master Data Model that internal and external clients can leverage for transactional, computable data exchange and processing.
