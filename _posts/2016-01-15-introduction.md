The Veterans Information System Technology Architecture (VISTA) is the comprehensive, integrated health information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This supports all clinical, financial, and administrative functions for the lifelong care of veterans at over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics throughout the United States. 

The VISTA Data Project is a new data-centric approach to comprehensively surfacing, representing, and managing the thirty-five years of patient data and institutional know-how currently in the VA's 131 nationally deployed VISTA systems using a modern  web-standard machine-processable Linked Data Model; and by enriching and operationalizing this model, make all relevant VISTA data securely accessible and computable across all VISTA systems through one standard Master VISTA Data Model.
