The VISTA Data Project is a Federal inter-agency health systems research and discovery project funded by the Veterans Affairs to 

> provide a single comprehensive security-enabled read/write data model for all VA VISTA data across all VA VISTA operational systems, establishing a common technical foundation for master data management and computable data representation and exchange between VA and DoD clinical information systems.

How? Where? Why?

<!--more-->

__How?__

>__All sources of available metadata__ (both __internal to VISTA as well as external__) will be __transformed to a single integrated web-standard data model__ which is then __annotated, normalized, and enriched__. This enhanced model is in turn is __embedded back in VISTA as a server-side, security-enabled, in-process, transactional read/write Master Data Model__.   

__Where?__

>__All artifacts and deliverables__ shall be developed, version-controlled, stored, and delivered on an industry-standard __public Github__ repository (“Project Repository”). ... The Project Repository shall contain the one and only authoritative version of all artifacts produced ... The government, all necessary stakeholders, and the __public__ shall have full read and download access of all artifacts on the Project Repository at all times --- See [PWS](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/blob/master/Submissions/src/VistAMetadata-2015-12-09-PWS.pdf) Section 1.6.15.1



## Features

Feature | Details
---|---
__Prototype-Driven__ |  Employs rapid iterative prototyping approach. *Not waterfall development*.
__Data-centric__ | Novel approach to managing VISTA data.  *Not a code-centric approach*.
__Representative__  | Exposes, leverages, and enhances all relevant, representative VA VISTA to the maximium extent available.  The VISTA Data Model comprises the current existing data-driven architecture of VISTA, and therefore leverages all existing VISTA definitions.
__Noninvasive__ | The VISTA Data Model provides essential new functionality on top of the unmodified VISTA architecture 'as is'. No existing VISTA code, routines, packages, modules, or infrastructure will be affected or changed in any way (i.e. this is 'safe' and 'noninvasive').
__Web-Standard <br>Data Model__  | Exposes VISTA data models and metadata using the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Web Data Model](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/tree/master/Background#standards) (RDF, JSON-LD).
